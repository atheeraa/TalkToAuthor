THE PROPHET Almustafa the chosen and the beloved who was a dawn unto his own day had waited twelve years in the city of Orphalese for his ship that was to return and bear him back to the isle of his birth And in the twelfth year on the seventh day of Ielool the month of reaping he climbed the hill without the city walls and looked seaward and he beheld his ship coming with the mist Then the gates of his heart were flung open and his joy flew far over the sea And he closed his eyes and prayed in the silences of his soul But as he descended the hill a sadness came upon him and he thought in his heart How shall I go in peace and without sorrow Nay not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls and long were the nights of aloneness and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets and too many are the children of my longing that walk naked among these hills and I cannot withdraw from them without a burden and an ache It is not a garment I cast off this day but a skin that I tear with my own hands Nor is it a thought I leave behind me but a heart made sweet with hunger and with thirst Yet I cannot tarry longer The sea that calls all things unto her calls me and I must embark For to stay though the hours burn in the night is to freeze and crystallize and be bound in a mould Fain would I take with me all that is here But how shall I A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that gave it wings Alone must it seek the ether And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun Now when he reached the foot of the hill he turned again towards the sea and he saw his ship approaching the harbour and upon her prow the mariners the men of his own land And his soul cried out to them and he said Sons of my ancient mother you riders of the tides How often have you sailed in my dreams And now you come in my awakening which is my deeper dream Ready am I to go and my eagerness with sails full set awaits the wind Only another breath will I breathe in this still air only another loving look cast backward And then I shall stand among you a seafarer among seafarers And you vast sea sleepless mother Who alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream Only another winding will this stream make only another murmur in this glade And then shall I come to you a boundless drop to a boundless ocean And as he walked he saw from afar men and women leaving their fields and their vineyards and hastening towards the city gates And he heard their voices calling his name and shouting from field to field telling one another of the coming of his ship And he said to himself Shall the day of parting be the day of gathering And shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn And what shall I give unto him who has left his plough in midfurrow or to him who has stopped the wheel of his winepress Shall my heart become a tree heavyladen with fruit that I may gather and give unto them And shall my desires flow like a fountain that I may fill their cups Am I a harp that the hand of the mighty may touch me or a flute that his breath may pass through me A seeker of silences am I and what treasure have I found in silences that I may dispense with confidence If this is my day of harvest in what fields have I sowed the seed and in what unremembered seasons If this indeed be the hour in which I lift up my lantern it is not my flame that shall burn therein Empty and dark shall I raise my lantern And the guardian of the night shall fill it with oil and he shall light it also These things he said in words But much in his heart remained unsaid For he himself could not speak his deeper secret Illustration And when he entered into the city all the people came to meet him and they were crying out to him as with one voice And the elders of the city stood forth and said Go not yet away from us A noontide have you been in our twilight and your youth has given us dreams to dream No stranger are you among us nor a guest but our son and our dearly beloved Suffer not yet our eyes to hunger for your face And the priests and the priestesses said unto him Let not the waves of the sea separate us now and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory You have walked among us a spirit and your shadow has been a light upon our faces Much have we loved you But speechless was our love and with veils has it been veiled Yet now it cries aloud unto you and would stand revealed before you And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation And others came also and entreated him But he answered them not He only bent his head and those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast And he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the temple And there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra And she was a seeress And he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness for it was she who had first sought and believed in him when he had been but a day in their city And she hailed him saying Prophet of God in quest of the uttermost long have you searched the distances for your ship And now your ship has come and you must needs go Deep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place of your greater desires and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you Yet this we ask ere you leave us that you speak to us and give us of your truth And we will give it unto our children and they unto their children and it shall not perish In your aloneness you have watched with our days and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep Now therefore disclose us to ourselves and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death And he answered People of Orphalese of what can I speak save of that which is even now moving within your souls Then said Almitra Speak to us of Love And he raised his head and looked upon the people and there fell a stillness upon them And with a great voice he said When love beckons to you follow him Though his ways are hard and steep And when his wings enfold you yield to him Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you And when he speaks to you believe in him Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself He threshes you to make you naked He sifts you to free you from your husks He grinds you to whiteness He kneads you until you are pliant And then he assigns you to his sacred fire that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart But if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshingfloor Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh but not all of your laughter and weep but not all of your tears Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself Love possesses not nor would it be possessed For love is sufficient unto love When you love you should not say “God is in my heart” but rather “I am in the heart of God” And think not you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself But if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night To know the pain of too much tenderness To be wounded by your own understanding of love And to bleed willingly and joyfully To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstacy To return home at eventide with gratitude And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips Illustration Then Almitra spoke again and said And what of Marriage master And he answered saying You were born together and together you shall be forevermore You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days Aye you shall be together even in the silent memory of God But let there be spaces in your togetherness And let the winds of the heavens dance between you Love one another but make not a bond of love Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf Sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music Give your hearts but not into each other’s keeping For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts And stand together yet not too near together For the pillars of the temple stand apart And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow Illustration And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said Speak to us of Children And he said Your children are not your children They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself They come through you but not from you And though they are with you yet they belong not to you You may give them your love but not your thoughts For they have their own thoughts You may house their bodies but not their souls For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which you cannot visit not even in your dreams You may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far Let your bending in the Archer’s hand be for gladness For even as he loves the arrow that flies so He loves also the bow that is stable Then said a rich man Speak to us of Giving And he answered You give but little when you give of your possessions It is when you give of yourself that you truly give For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow And tomorrow what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city And what is fear of need but need itself Is not dread of thirst when your well is full the thirst that is unquenchable There are those who give little of the much which they haveand they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome And there are those who have little and give it all These are the believers in life and the bounty of life and their coffer is never empty There are those who give with joy and that joy is their reward And there are those who give with pain and that pain is their baptism And there are those who give and know not pain in giving nor do they seek joy nor give with mindfulness of virtue They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space Through the hands of such as these God speaks and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth Illustration It is well to give when asked but it is better to give unasked through understanding And to the openhanded the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving And is there aught you would withhold All you have shall some day be given Therefore give now that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors’ You often say “I would give but only to the deserving” The trees in your orchard say not so nor the flocks in your pasture They give that they may live for to withhold is to perish Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence nay the charity of receiving And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver and an instrument of giving For in truth it is life that gives unto lifewhile you who deem yourself a giver are but a witness And you receiversand you are all receiversassume no weight of gratitude lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings For to be overmindful of your debt is ito doubt his generosity who has the freehearted earth for mother and God for father Illustration Then an old man a keeper of an inn said Speak to us of Eating and Drinking And he said Would that you could live on the fragrance of the earth and like an air plant be sustained by the light But since you must kill to eat and rob the newly born of its mother’s milk to quench your thirst let it then be an act of worship And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacrificed for that which is purer and still more innocent in man When you kill a beast say to him in your heart “By the same power that slays you I too am slain and I too shall be consumed For the law that delivered you into my hand shall deliver me into a mightier hand Your blood and my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of heaven” And when you crush an apple with your teeth say to it in your heart “Your seeds shall live in my body And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart And your fragrance shall be my breath And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons” And in the autumn when you gather the grapes of your vineyards for the winepress say in your heart “I too am a vineyard and my fruit shall be gathered for the winepress And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels” And in winter when you draw the wine let there be in your heart a song for each cup And let there be in the song a remembrance for the autumn days and for the vineyard and for the winepress Then a ploughman said Speak to us of Work And he answered saying You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons and to step out of life’s procession that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music Which of you would be a reed dumb and silent when all else sings together in unison Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth’s furthest dream assigned to you when that dream was born And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written You have been told also that life is darkness and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary And I say that life is indeed darkness ‘save when there is urge And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge And all knowledge is vain save when there is work And all work is empty save when there is love And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself and to one another and to God And what is it to work with love It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth It is to build a house with affection even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching Often have I heard you say as if speaking in sleep “He who works in marble and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone is nobler than he who ploughs the soil And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet” But I say not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving Work is love made visible And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy For if you bake bread with indifference you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes your grudge distils a poison in the wine And if you sing though as angels and love not the singing you muffle man’s ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night Then a woman said Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow And he answered Your joy is your sorrow unmasked And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears And how else can it be The deeper that sorrow carves into your being the more joy you can contain Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven And is not the lute that soothes your spirit the very wood that was hollowed with knives When you are joyous look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy When you are sorrowful look again in your heart and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight Some of you say “Joy is greater than sorrow” and others say “Nay sorrow is the greater” But I say unto you they are inseparable Together they come and when one sits alone with you at your board remember that the other is asleep upon your bed Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced When the treasurekeeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall Then a mason came forth and said Speak to us of Houses And he answered and said Build of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house within the city walls For even as you have homecomings in your twilight so has the wanderer in you the ever distant and alone Your house is your larger body It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night and it is not dreamless Does not your house dream and dreaming leave the city for grove or hilltop Would that I could gather your houses into my hand and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow Would the valleys were your streets and the green paths your alleys that you might seek one another through vineyards and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments But these things are not yet to be In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together And that fear shall endure a little longer A little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths from your fields And tell me people of Orphalese what have you in these houses And what is it you guard with fastened doors Have you peace the quiet urge that reveals your power Have you remembrances the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind Have you beauty that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy mountain Tell me have you these in your houses Or have you only comfort and the lust for comfort that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest and then becomes a host and then a master Ay and it becomes a tamer and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires Though its hands are silken its heart is of iron It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh It makes mock of your sound senses and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul and then walks grinning in the funeral But you children of space you restless in rest you shall not be trapped nor tamed Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast It shall not be a glistening film that covers a wound but an eyelid that guards the eye You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack and fall down You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living And though of magnificence and splendour your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky whose door is the morning mist and whose windows are the songs and the silences of night And the weaver said Speak to us of Clothes And he answered Your clothes conceal much of your beauty yet they hide not the unbeautiful And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the wind Some of you say “It is the north wind who has woven the clothes we wear” And I say Ay it was the north wind But shame was his loom and the softening of the sinews was his thread And when his work was done he laughed in the forest Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean And when the unclean shall be no more what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair And a merchant said Speak to us of Buying and Selling And he answered and said To you the earth yields her fruit and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied Yet unless the exchange be in love and kindly justice it will but lead some to greed and others to hunger When in the market place you toilers of the sea and fields and vineyards meet the weavers and the potters and the gatherers of spices Invoke then the master spirit of the earth to come into your midst and sanctify the scales and the reckoning that weighs value against value And suffer not the barrenhanded to take part in your transactions who would sell their words for your labour To such men you should say “Come with us to the field or go with our brothers to the sea and cast your net For the land and the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us” And if there come the singers and the dancers and the flute playersbuy of their gifts also For they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense and that which they bring though fashioned of dreams is raiment and food for your soul And before you leave the market place see that no one has gone his way with empty hands For the master spirit of the earth shall not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the needs of the least of you are satisfied Then one of the judges of the city stood forth and said Speak to us of Crime and Punishment And he answered saying It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind That you alone and unguarded commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed Like the ocean is your godself It remains for ever undefiled And like the ether it lifts but the winged Even like the sun is your godself It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent But your godself dwells not alone in your being Much in you is still man and much in you is not yet man But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening And of the man in you would I now speak For it is he and not your godself nor the pigmy in the mist that knows crime and the punishment of crime Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree So the wrongdoer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all Like a procession you walk together towards your godself Illustration You are the way and the wayfarers And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him a caution against the stumbling stone Ay and he falls for those ahead of him who though faster and surer of foot yet removed not the stumbling stone And this also though the word lie heavy upon your hearts The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked And the whitehanded is not clean in the doings of the felon Yea the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured And still more often the condemned is the burden bearer for the guiltless and unblamed You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together And when the black thread breaks the weaver shall look into the whole cloth and he shall examine the loom also If any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife Let him also weigh the heart of her husband in scales and measure his soul with measurements And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the ax unto the evil tree let him see to its roots And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad the fruitful and the fruitless all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth And you judges who would be just What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an oppressor Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty Unbidden shall it call in the night that men may wake and gaze upon themselves And you who would understand justice how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light Only then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmyself and the day of his godself And that the cornerstone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation Then a lawyer said But what of our Laws master And he answered You delight in laying down laws Yet you delight more in breaking them Like children playing by the ocean who build sandtowers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter But while you build your sandtowers the ocean brings more sand to the shore And when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent But what of those to whom life is not an ocean and manmade laws are not sandtowers But to whom life is a rock and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness What of the cripple who hates dancers What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin and calls all others naked and shameless And of him who comes early to the weddingfeast and when overfed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters lawbreakers What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight but with their backs to the sun They see only their shadows and their shadows are their laws And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth But you who walk facing the sun what images drawn on the earth can hold you You who travel with the wind what weathervane shall direct your course What man’s law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man’s prison door What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man’s iron chains And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man’s path People of Orphalese you can muffle the drum and you can loosen the strings of the lyre but who shall command the skylark not to sing And an orator said Speak to us of Freedom And he answered At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them Ay in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff And my heart bled within me for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfilment You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free If it is an unjust law you would abolish that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges though you pour the sea upon them And if it is a despot you would dethrone see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride And if it is a care you would cast off that cart has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you And if it is a fear you would dispel the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace the desired and the dreaded the repugnant and the cherished the pursued and that which you would escape These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling And when the shadow fades and is no more the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom And the priestess spoke again and said Speak to us of Reason and Passion And he answered saying Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield upon which your reason and your judgment wage war against your passion and your appetite Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul that I might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody But how shall I unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers nay the lovers of all your elements Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul If either your sails or your rudder be broken you can but toss and drift or else be held at a standstill in midseas For reason ruling alone is a force confining and passion unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion that it may sing And let it direct your passion with reason that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes I would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house Surely you would not honour one guest above the other for he who is more mindful of one loses the love and the faith of both Among the hills when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadowsthen let your heart say in silence “God rests in reason” And when the storm comes and the mighty wind shakes the forest and thunder and lightning proclaim the majesty of the skythen let your heart say in awe “God moves in passion” And since you are a breath in God’s sphere and a leaf in God’s forest you too should rest in reason and move in passion And a woman spoke saying Tell us of Pain And he said Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding Even as the stone of the fruit must break that its heart may stand in the sun so must you know pain And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy And you would accept the seasons of your heart even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief Much of your pain is selfchosen It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self Therefore trust the physician and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity For his hand though heavy and hard is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen And the cup he brings though it burn your lips has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears And a man said Speak to us of SelfKnowledge And he answered saying Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge You would know in words that which you have always known in thought You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams And it is well you should The hidden wellspring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line For self is a sea boundless and measureless Say not “I have found the truth” but rather “I have found a truth” Say not “I have found the path of the soul” Say rather “I have met the soul walking upon my path” For the soul walks upon all paths The soul walks not upon a line neither does it grow like a reed The soul unfolds itself like a lotus of countless petals Illustration Then said a teacher Speak to us of Teaching And he said “No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple among his followers gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind The astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space but he cannot give you his understanding The musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space but he cannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it And he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight and measure but he cannot conduct you thither For the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man And even as each one of you stands alone in God’s knowledge so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth And a youth said Speak to us of Friendship And he answered saying Your friend is your needs answered He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving And he is your board and your fireside For you come to him with your hunger and you seek him for peace When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind nor do you withhold the “ay” And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart For without words in friendship all thoughts all desires all expectations are born and shared with joy that is unacclaimed When you part from your friend you grieve not For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth and only the unprofitable is caught And let your best be for your friend If he must know the ebb of your tide let him know its flood also For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill Seek him always with hours to live For it is his to fill your need but not your emptiness And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed And then a scholar said Speak of Talking And he answered saying You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips and sound is a diversion and a pastime And in much of your talking thinking is half murdered For thought is a bird of space that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape And there are those who talk and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand And there are those who have the truth within them but they tell it not in words In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more And an astronomer said Master what of Time And he answered You would measure time the measureless and the immeasurable You would adjust your conduct and even direct the course of your spirit according to hours and seasons Of time you would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing Yet the timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness And knows that yesterday is but today’s memory and tomorrow is today’s dream And that that which sings and contemplates in you is still dwelling within the bounds of that first moment which scattered the stars into space Who among you does not feel that his power to love is boundless And yet who does not feel that very love though boundless encompassed within the centre of his being and moving not from love thought to love thought nor from love deeds to other love deeds And is not time even as love is undivided and paceless But if in your thought you must measure time into seasons let each season encircle all the other seasons And let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing And one of the elders of the city said Speak to us of Good and Evil And he answered Of the good in you I can speak but not of the evil For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters You are good when you are one with yourself Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil For a divided house is not a den of thieves it is only a divided house And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom You are good when you strive to give of yourself Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast Surely the fruit cannot say to the root “Be like me ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance” For to the fruit giving is a need as receiving is a need to the root You are good when you are fully awake in your speech Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping Even those who limp go not backward But you who are strong and swift see that you do not limp before the lame deeming it kindness You are good in countless ways and you are not evil when you are not good You are only loitering and sluggard Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness and that longing is in all of you But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea carrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends and lingers before it reaches the shore But let not him who longs much say to him who longs little “Wherefore are you slow and halting” For the truly good ask not the naked “Where is your garment” nor the houseless “What has befallen your house” Then a priestess said Speak to us of Prayer And he answered saying You pray in your distress and in your need would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance For what is prayer but the expansion of yourself into the living ether And if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space it is also for your delight to pour forth the dawning of your heart And if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer she should spur you again and yet again though weeping until you shall come laughing When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour and whom save in prayer you may not meet Therefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but ecstasy and sweet communion For if you should enter the temple for no other purpose than asking you shall not receive And if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be lifted Or even if you should enter into it to beg for the good of others you shall not be heard It is enough that you enter the temple invisible I cannot teach you how to pray in words God listens not to your words save when He Himself utters them through your lips And I cannot teach you the prayer of the seas and the forests and the mountains But you who are born of the mountains and the forests and the seas can find their prayer in your heart And if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them saying in silence “Our God who art our winged self it is thy will in us that willeth It is thy desire in us that desireth It is thy urge in us that would turn our nights which are thine into days which are thine also We cannot ask thee for aught for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us Thou art our need and in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all” Illustration Then a hermit who visited the city once a year came forth and said Speak to us of Pleasure And he answered saying Pleasure is a freedomsong But it is not freedom It is the blossoming of your desires But it is not their fruit It is a depth calling unto a height But it is not the deep nor the high It is the caged taking wing But it is not space encompassed Ay in very truth pleasure is a freedomsong And I fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart yet I would not have you lose your hearts in the singing Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all and they are judged and rebuked I would not judge nor rebuke them I would have them seek For they shall find pleasure but not her alone Seven are her sisters and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots and found a treasure And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs committed in drunkenness But regret is the beclouding of the mind and not its chastisement They should remember their pleasures with gratitude as they would the harvest of a summer Yet if it comforts them to regret let them be comforted And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to remember And in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all pleasures lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it But even in their foregoing is their pleasure And thus they too find a treasure though they dig for roots with quivering hands But tell me who is he that can offend the spirit Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of the night or the firefly the stars And shall your flame or your smoke burden the wind Think you the spirit is a still pool which you can trouble with a staff Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in the recesses of your being Who knows but that which seems omitted today waits for tomorrow Even your body knows its heritage and its rightful need and will not be deceived And your body is the harp of your soul And it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or confused sounds And now you ask in your heart “How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good” Go to your fields and your gardens and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love And to both bee and flower the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy People of Orphalese be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees And a poet said Speak to us of Beauty And he answered Where shall you seek beauty and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech The aggrieved and the injured say “Beauty is kind and gentle Like a young mother halfshy of her own glory she walks among us” And the passionate say “Nay beauty is a thing of might and dread Like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us” The tired and the weary say “Beauty is of soft whisperings She speaks in our spirit Her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow” But the restless say “We have heard her shouting among the mountains And with her cries came the sound of hoofs and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions” At night the watchmen of the city say “Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east” And at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say “We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset” In winter say the snowbound “She shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills” And in the summer heat the reapers say “We have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves and we saw a drift of snow in her hair” All these things have you said of beauty Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth But rather a heart enflamed and a soul enchanted It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear But rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears It is not the sap within the furrowed bark nor a wing attached to a claw But rather a garden for ever in bloom and a flock of angels for ever in flight People of Orphalese beauty is life when life unveils her holy face But you are life and you are the veil Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror But you are eternity and you are the mirror And an old priest said Speak to us of Religion And he said Have I spoken this day of aught else Is not religion all deeds and all reflection And that which is neither deed nor reflection but a wonder and a surprise ever springing in the soul even while the hands hew the stone or tend the loom Who can separate his faith from his actions or his belief from his occupations Who can spread his hours before him saying “This for God and this for myself This for my soul and this other for my body” All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked The wind and the sun will tear no holes in his skin And he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his songbird in a cage The freest song comes not through bars and wires And he to whom worshipping is a window to open but also to shut has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn Your daily life is your temple and your religion Whenever you enter into it take with you your all Take the plough and the forge and the mallet and the lute The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight For in revery you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures And take with you all men For in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair And if you would know God be not therefore a solver of riddles Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children And look into space you shall see Him walking in the cloud outstretching His arms in the lightning and descending in rain You shall see Him smiling in flowers then rising and waving His hands in trees Then Almitra spoke saying We would ask now of Death And he said You would know the secret of death But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life The owl whose nightbound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light If you would indeed behold the spirit of death open your heart wide unto the body of life For life and death are one even as the river and the sea are one In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring Trust the dreams for in them is hidden the gate to eternity Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling that he shall wear the mark of the king Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun And what is it to cease breathing but to free the breath from its restless tides that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing And when you have reached the mountain top then you shall begin to climb And when the earth shall claim your limbs then shall you truly dance And now it was evening And Almitra the seeress said Blessed be this day and this place and your spirit that has spoken And he answered Was it I who spoke Was I not also a listener Then he descended the steps of the Temple and all the people followed him And he reached his ship and stood upon the deck And facing the people again he raised his voice and said People of Orphalese the wind bids me leave you Less hasty am I than the wind yet I must go We wanderers ever seeking the lonelier way begin no day where we have ended another day and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us Even while the earth sleeps we travel We are the seeds of the tenacious plant and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered Brief were my days among you and briefer still the words I have spoken But should my voice fade in your ears and my love vanish in your memory then I will come again And with a richer heart and lips more yielding to the spirit will I speak Yea I shall return with the tide And though death may hide me and the greater silence enfold me yet again will I seek your understanding And not in vain will I seek If aught I have said is truth that truth shall reveal itself in a clearer voice and in words more kin to your thoughts I go with the wind people of Orphalese but not down into emptiness And if this day is not a fulfilment of your needs and my love then let it be a promise till another day Man’s needs change but not his love nor his desire that his love should satisfy his needs Know therefore that from the greater silence I shall return The mist that drifts away at dawn leaving but dew in the fields shall rise and gather into a cloud and then fall down in rain And not unlike the mist have I been In the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets and my spirit has entered your houses And your heartbeats were in my heart and your breath was upon my face and I knew you all Ay I knew your joy and your pain and in your sleep your dreams were my dreams And oftentimes I was among you a lake among the mountains I mirrored the summits in you and the bending slopes and even the passing flocks of your thoughts and your desires And to my silence came the laughter of your children in streams and the longing of your youths in rivers And when they reached my depth the streams and the rivers ceased not yet to sing Illustration But sweeter still than laughter and greater than longing came to me It was the boundless in you The vast man in whom you are all but cells and sinews He in whose chant all your singing is but a soundless throbbing It is in the vast man that you are vast And in beholding him that I beheld you and loved you For what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere What visions what expectations and what presumptions can outsoar that flight Like a giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is the vast man in you His might binds you to the earth his fragrance lifts you into space and in his durability you are deathless You have been told that even like a chain you are as weak as your weakest link This is but half the truth You are also as strong as your strongest link To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy Ay you are like an ocean And though heavygrounded ships await the tide upon your shores yet even like an ocean you cannot hasten your tides And like the seasons you are also And though in your winter you deny your spring Yet spring reposing within you smiles in her drowsiness and is not offended Think not I say these things in order that you may say the one to the other “He praised us well He saw but the good in us” I only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought And what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge Your thoughts and my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays And of the ancient days when the earth knew not us nor herself And of nights when earth was upwrought with confusion Wise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom I came to take of your wisdom And behold I have found that which is greater than wisdom It is a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself While you heedless of its expansion bewail the withering of your days It is life in quest of life in bodies that fear the grave There are no graves here These mountains and plains are a cradle and a steppingstone Whenever you pass by the field where you have laid your ancestors look well thereupon and you shall see yourselves and your children dancing hand in hand Verily you often make merry without knowing Others have come to you to whom for golden promises made unto your faith you have given but riches and power and glory Less than a promise have I given and yet more generous have you been to me You have given me my deeper thirsting after life Surely there is no greater gift to a man than that which turns all his aims into parching lips and all life into a fountain Illustration And in this lies my honour and my reward That whenever I come to the fountain to drink I find the living water itself thirsty And it drinks me while I drink it Some of you have deemed me proud and overshy to receive gifts Too proud indeed am I to receive wages but not gifts And though I have eaten berries among the hills when you would have had me sit at your board And slept in the portico of the temple when you would gladly have sheltered me Yet was it not your loving mindfulness of my days and my nights that made food sweet to my mouth and girdled my sleep with visions For this I bless you most You give much and know not that you give at all Verily the kindness that gazes upon itself in a mirror turns to stone And a good deed that calls itself by tender names becomes the parent to a curse And some of you have called me aloof and drunk with my own aloneness And you have said “He holds council with the trees of the forest but not with men He sits alone on hilltops and looks down upon our city” True it is that I have climbed the hills and walked in remote places How could I have seen you save from a great height or a great distance How can one be indeed near unless he be far And others among you called unto me not in words and they said “Stranger stranger lover of unreachable heights why dwell you among the summits where eagles build their nests Why seek you the unattainable What storms would you trap in your net And what vaporous birds do you hunt in the sky Come and be one of us Descend and appease your hunger with our bread and quench your thirst with our wine” In the solitude of their souls they said these things But were their solitude deeper they would have known that I sought but the secret of your joy and your pain And I hunted only your larger selves that walk the sky But the hunter was also the hunted For many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast And the flier was also the creeper For when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon the earth was a turtle And I the believer was also the doubter For often have I put my finger in my own wound that I might have the greater belief in you and the greater knowledge of you And it is with this belief and this knowledge that I say You are not enclosed within your bodies nor confined to houses or fields That which is you dwells above the mountain and roves with the wind It is not a thing that crawls into the sun for warmth or digs holes into darkness for safety But a thing free a spirit that envelops the earth and moves in the ether If these be vague words then seek not to clear them Vague and nebulous is the beginning of all things but not their end And I fain would have you remember me as a beginning Life and all that lives is conceived in the mist and not in the crystal And who knows but a crystal is mist in decay This would I have you remember in remembering me That which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is the strongest and most determined Is it not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your bones And is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt that builded your city and fashioned all there is in it Could you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all else And if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound But you do not see nor do you hear and it is well The veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wove it And the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it And you shall see And you shall hear Yet you shall not deplore having known blindness nor regret having been deaf For in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things And you shall bless darkness as you would bless light After saying these things he looked about him and he saw the pilot of his ship standing by the helm and gazing now at the full sails and now at the distance And he said Patient over patient is the captain of my ship The wind blows and restless are the sails Even the rudder begs direction Yet quietly my captain awaits my silence And these my mariners who have heard the choir of the greater sea they too have heard me patiently Now they shall wait no longer I am ready The stream has reached the sea and once more the great mother holds her son against her breast Fare you well people of Orphalese This day has ended It is closing upon us even as the waterlily upon its own tomorrow What was given us here we shall keep And if it suffices not then again must we come together and together stretch our hands unto the giver Forget not that I shall come back to you A little while and my longing shall gather dust and foam for another body A little while a moment of rest upon the wind and another woman shall bear me Farewell to you and the youth I have spent with you It was but yesterday we met in a dream You have sung to me in my aloneness and I of your longings have built a tower in the sky But now our sleep has fled and our dream is over and it is no longer dawn The noontide is upon us and our half waking has turned to fuller day and we must part If in the twilight of memory we should meet once more we shall speak again together and you shall sing to me a deeper song And if our hands should meet in another dream we shall build another tower in the sky So saying he made a signal to the seamen and straightway they weighed anchor and cast the ship loose from its moorings and they moved eastward And a cry came from the people as from a single heart and it rose into the dusk and was carried out over the sea like a great trumpeting Only Almitra was silent gazing after the ship until it had vanished into the mist And when all the people were dispersed she still stood alone upon the seawall remembering in her heart his saying “A little while a moment of rest upon the wind and another woman shall bear me” You ask me how I became a madman It happened thus One day long before many gods were born I woke from a deep sleep and found all my masks were stolenthe seven masks I have fashioned and worn in seven livesI ran maskless through the crowded streets shouting Thieves thieves the cursed thieves Men and women laughed at me and some ran to their houses in fear of me And when I reached the market place a youth standing on a housetop cried He is a madman I looked up to behold him the sun kissed my own naked face for the first time For the first time the sun kissed my own naked face and my soul was inflamed with love for the sun and I wanted my masks no more And as if in a trance I cried Blessed blessed are the thieves who stole my masks Thus I became a madman And I have found both freedom and safety in my madness the freedom of loneliness and the safety from being understood for those who understand us enslave something in us But let me not be too proud of my safety Even a Thief in a jail is safe from another thief God In the ancient days when the first quiver of speech came to my lips I ascended the holy mountain and spoke unto God saying Master I am thy slave Thy hidden will is my law and I shall obey thee for ever more But God made no answer and like a mighty tempest passed away And after a thousand years I ascended the holy mountain and again spoke unto God saying Creator I am thy creation Out of clay hast thou fashioned me and to thee I owe mine all And God made no answer but like a thousand swift wings passed away And after a thousand years I climbed the holy mountain and spoke unto God again saying Father I am thy son In pity and love thou hast given me birth and through love and worship I shall inherit thy kingdom And God made no answer and like the mist that veils the distant hills he passed away And after a thousand years I climbed the sacred mountain and again spoke unto God saying My God my aim and my fulfillment I am thy yesterday and thou are my tomorrow I am thy root in the earth and thou art my flower in the sky and together we grow before the face of the sun Then God leaned over me and in my ears whispered words of sweetness and even as the sea that enfoldeth a brook that runneth down to her he enfolded me And when I descended to the valleys and the plains God was there also My Friend My friend I am not what I seem Seeming is but a garment I weara carewoven garment that protects me from thy questionings and thee from my negligence The I in me my friend dwells in the house of silence and therein it shall remain for ever more unperceived unapproachable I would not have thee believe in what I say nor trust in what I dofor my words are naught but thy own thoughts in sound and my deeds thy own hopes in action When thou sayest The wind bloweth eastward I say Aye it doth blow eastward for I would not have thee know that my mind doth not dwell upon the wind but upon the sea Thou canst not understand my seafaring thoughts nor would I have thee understand I would be at sea alone When it is day with thee my friend it is night with me yet even then I speak of the noontide that dances upon the hills and of the purple shadow that steals its way across the valley for thou canst not hear the songs of my darkness nor see my wings beating against the starsand I fain would not have thee hear or see I would be with night alone When thou ascendest to thy Heaven I descend to my Helleven then thou callest to me across the unbridgeable gulf My companion my comrade and I call back to thee My comrade my companionfor I would not have thee see my Hell The flame would burn thy eyesight and the smoke would crowd thy nostrils And I love my Hell too well to have thee visit it I would be in Hell alone Thou lovest Truth and Beauty and Righteousness and I for thy sake say it is well and seemly to love these things But in my heart I laught at thy love Yet I would not have thee see my laughter I would laugh alone My friend thou art good and cautious and wise nay thou art perfectand I too speak with thee wisely and cautiously And yet I am mad But I mask my madness I would be mad alone My friend thou art not my friend but how shall I make thee understand My path is not thy path yet together we walk hand in hand The Scarecrow Once I said to a scarecrow You must be tired of standing in this lonely field And he said The joy of scaring is a deep and lasting one and I never tire of it Said I after a minute of thought It is true for I too have known that joy Said he Only those who are stuffed with straw can know it Then I left him not knowing whether he had complimented or belittled me A year passed during which the scarecrow turned philosopher And when I passed by him again I saw two crows building a nest under his hat The SleepWalkers In the town where I was born lived a woman and her daughter who walked in their sleep One night while silence enfolded the world the woman and her daughter walking yet asleep met in their mistveiled garden And the mother spoke and she said At last at last my enemy You by whom my youth was destroyedwho have built up your life upon the ruins of mine Would I could kill you And the daughter spoke and she said O hateful woman selfish and old Who stand between my freer self and me Who would have my life an echo of your own faded life Would you were dead At that moment a cock crew and both women awoke The mother said gently Is that you darling And the daughter answered gently Yes dear The Wise Dog One day there passed by a company of cats a wise dog And as he came near and saw that they were very intent and heeded him not he stopped Then there arose in the midst of the company a large grave cat and looked upon them and said Brethren pray ye and when ye have prayed again and yet again nothing doubting verily then it shall rain mice And when the dog heard this he laughed in his heart and turned from them saying O blind and foolish cats has it not been written and have I not known and my fathers before me that that which raineth for prayer and faith and supplication is not mice but bones The Two Hermits Upon a lonely mountain there lived two hermits who worshipped God and loved one another Now these two hermits had one earthen bowl and this was their only possession One day an evil spirit entered into the heart of the older hermit and he came to the younger and said It is long that we have lived together The time has come for us to part Let us divide our possessions Then the younger hermit was saddened and he said It grieves me Brother that thou shouldst leave me But if thou must needs go so be it and he brought the earthen bowl and gave it to him saying We cannot divide it Brother let it be thine Then the older hermit said Charity I will not accept I will take nothing but mine own It must be divided And the younger one said If the bowl be broken of what use would it be to thee or to me If it be thy pleasure let us rather cast a lot But the older hermit said again I will have but justice and mine own and I will not trust justice and mine own to vain chance The bowl must be divided Then the younger hermit could reason no further and he said If it be indeed thy will and if even so thou wouldst have it let us now break the bowl But the face of the older hermit grew exceedingly dark and he cried O thou cursed coward thou wouldst not fight On Giving and Taking Once there lived a man who had a valleyfull of needles And one day the mother of Jesus came to him and said Friend my sons garment is torn and I must needs mend it before he goeth to the temple Wouldst thou not give me a needle And he gave her not a needle but he gave her a learned discourse on Giving and Taking to carry to her son before he should go to the temple The Seven Selves In the stillest hour of the night as I lay half asleep my seven selves sat together and thus conversed in whisper First Self Here in this madman I have dwelt all these years with naught to do but renew his pain by day and recreate his sorrow by night I can bear my fate no longer and now I rebel Second Self Yours is a better lot than mine brother for it is given to me to be this madmans joyous self I laugh his laughter and sing his happy hours and with thrice winged feet I dance his brighter thoughts It is I that would rebel against my weary existence Third Self And what of me the loveridden self the flaming brand of wild passion and fantastic desires It is I the lovesick self who would rebel against this madman Fourth Self I amongst you all am the most miserable for naught was given me but odious hatred and destructive loathing It is I the tempestlike self the one born in the black caves of Hell who would protest against serving this madman Fifth Self Nay it is I the thinking self the fanciful self the self of hunger and thirst the one doomed to wander without rest in search of unknown things and things not yet created it is I not you who would rebel Sixth Self And I the working self the pitiful labourer who with patient hands and longing eyes fashion the days into images and give the formless elements new and eternal formsit is I the solitary one who would rebel against this restless madman Seventh Self How strange that you all would rebel against this man because each and every one of you has a preordained fate to fulfill Ah could I but be like one of you a self with a determined lot But I have none I am the donothing self the one who sits in the dumb empty nowhere and nowhen while you are busy recreating life Is it you or I neighbours who should rebel When the seventh self thus spake the other six selves looked with pity upon him but said nothing more and as the night grew deeper one after the other went to sleep enfolded with a new and happy submission But the seventh self remained watching and gazing at nothingness which is behind all things War One night a feast was held in the palace and there came a man and prostrated himself before the prince and all the feasters looked upon him and they saw that one of his eyes was out and that the empty socket bled And the prince inquired of him What has befallen you And the man replied O prince I am by profession a thief and this night because there was no moon I went to rob the moneychangers shop and as I climbed in through the window I made a mistake and entered the weavers shop and in the dark I ran into the weavers loom and my eye was plucked out And now O prince I ask for justice upon the weaver Then the prince sent for the weaver and he came and it was decreed that one of his eyes should be plucked out O prince said the weaver the decree is just It is right that one of my eyes be taken And yet alas both are necessary to me in order that I may see the two sides of the cloth that I weave But I have a neighbour a cobbler who has also two eyes and in his trade both eyes are not necessary Then the prince sent for the cobbler And he came And they took out one of the cobblers two eyes And justice was satisfied The Fox A fox looked at his shadow at sunrise and said I will have a camel for lunch today And all morning he went about looking for camels But at noon he saw his shadow againand he said A mouse will do The Wise King Once there ruled in the distant city of Wirani a king who was both mighty and wise And he was feared for his might and loved for his wisdom Now in the heart of that city was a well whose water was cool and crystalline from which all the inhabitants drank even the king and his courtiers for there was no other well One night when all were asleep a witch entered the city and poured seven drops of strange liquid into the well and said From this hour he who drinks this water shall become mad Next morning all the inhabitants save the king and his lord chamberlain drank from the well and became mad even as the witch had foretold And during that day the people in the narrow streets and in the market places did naught but whisper to one another The king is mad Our king and his lord chamberlain have lost their reason Surely we cannot be ruled by a mad king We must dethrone him That evening the king ordered a golden goblet to be filled from the well And when it was brought to him he drank deeply and gave it to his lord chamberlain to drink And there was great rejoicing in that distant city of Wirani because its king and its lord chamberlain had regained their reason Ambition Three men met at a tavern table One was a weaver another a carpenter and the third a ploughman Said the weaver I sold a fine linen shroud today for two pieces of gold Let us have all the wine we want And I said the carpenter I sold my best coffin We will have a great roast with the wine I only dug a grave said the ploughman but my patron paid me double Let us have honey cakes too And all that evening the tavern was busy for they called often for wine and meat and cakes And they were merry And the host rubbed his hands and smiled at his wife for his guests were spending freely When they left the moon was high and they walked along the road singing and shouting together The host and his wife stood in the tavern door and looked after them Ah said the wife these gentlemen So freehanded and so gay If only they could bring us such luck every day Then our son need not be a tavernkeeper and work so hard We could educate him and he could become a priest The New Pleasure Last night I invented a new pleasure and as I was giving it the first trial an angel and a devil came rushing toward my house They met at my door and fought with each other over my newly created pleasure the one crying It is a sinthe other It is a virtue The Other Language Three days after I was born as I lay in my silken cradle gazing with astonished dismay on the new world round about me my mother spoke to the wetnurse saying How does my child And the wetnurse answered He does well Madame I have fed him three times and never before have I seen a babe so young yet so gay And I was indignant and I cried It is not true mother for my bed is hard and the milk I have sucked is bitter to my mouth and the odour of the breast is foul in my nostrils and I am most miserable But my mother did not understand nor did the nurse for the language I spoke was that of the world from which I came And on the twentyfirst day of my life as I was being christened the priest said to my mother You should indeed by happy Madame that your son was born a Christian And I was surprisedand I said to the priest Then your mother in Heaven should be unhappy for you were not born a Christian But the priest too did not understand my language And after seven moons one day a soothsayer looked at me and he said to my mother Your son will be a statesman and a great leader of men But I cried outThat is a false prophet for I shall be a musician and naught but a musician shall I be But even at that age my language was not understoodand great was my astonishment And after three and thirty years during which my mother and the nurse and the priest have all died the shadow of God be upon their spirits the soothsayer still lives And yesterday I met him near the gates of the temple and while we were talking together he said I have always known you would become a great musician Even in your infancy I prophesied and foretold your future And I believed himfor now I too have forgotten the language of that other world The Pomegranate Once when I was living in the heart of a pomegranate I heard a seed saying Someday I shall become a tree and the wind will sing in my branches and the sun will dance on my leaves and I shall be strong and beautiful through all the seasons Then another seed spoke and said When I was as young as you I too held such views but now that I can weigh and measure things I see that my hopes were vain And a third seed spoke also I see in us nothing that promises so great a future And a fourth said But what a mockery our life would be without a greater future Said a fifth Why dispute what we shall be when we know not even what we are But a sixth replied Whatever we are that we shall continue to be And a seventh said I have such a clear idea how everything will be but I cannot put it into words Then an eight spokeand a ninthand a tenthand then manyuntil all were speaking and I could distinguish nothing for the many voices And so I moved that very day into the heart of a quince where the seeds are few and almost silent The Two Cages In my fathers garden there are two cages In one is a lion which my fathers slaves brought from the desert of Ninavah in the other is a songless sparrow Every day at dawn the sparrow calls to the lion Good morrow to thee brother prisoner The Three Ants Three ants met on the nose of a man who was asleep in the sun And after they had saluted one another each according to the custom of his tribe they stood there conversing The first ant said These hills and plains are the most barren I have known I have searched all day for a grain of some sort and there is none to be found Said the second ant I too have found nothing though I have visited every nook and glade This is I believe what my people call the soft moving land where nothing grows Then the third ant raised his head and said My friends we are standing now on the nose of the Supreme Ant the mighty and infinite Ant whose body is so great that we cannot see it whose shadow is so vast that we cannot trace it whose voice is so loud that we cannot hear it and He is omnipresent When the third ant spoke thus the other ants looked at each other and laughed At that moment the man moved and in his sleep raised his hand and scratched his nose and the three ants were crushed The GraveDigger Once as I was burying one of my dead selves the gravedigger came by and said to me Of all those who come here to bury you alone I like Said I You please me exceedingly but why do you like me Because said he They come weeping and go weepingyou only come laughing and go laughing On the Steps of the Temple Yestereve on the marble steps of the Temple I saw a woman sitting between two men One side of her face was pale the other was blushing The Blessed City In my youth I was told that in a certain city every one lived according to the Scriptures And I said I will seek that city and the blessedness thereof And it was far And I made great provision for my journey And after forty days I beheld the city and on the fortyfirst day I entered into it And lo the whole company of the inhabitants had each but a single eye and but one hand And I was astonished and said to myself Shall they of this so holy city have but one eye and one hand Then I saw that they too were astonished for they were marveling greatly at my two hands and my two eyes And as they were speaking together I inquired of them saying Is this indeed the Blessed City where each man lives according to the Scriptures And they said Yes this is that city And what said I hath befallen you and where are your right eyes and your right hands And all the people were moved And they said Come thou and see And they took me to the temple in the midst of the city And in the temple I saw a heap of hands and eyes All withered Then said I Alas what conqueror hath committed this cruelty upon you And there went a murmur amongst them And one of their elders stood forth and said This doing is of ourselves God hath made us conquerors over the evil that was in us And he led me to a high altar and all the people followed And he showed me above the altar an inscription graven and I read If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that the whole body should be cast into hell And if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell Then I understood And I turned about to all the people and cried Hath no man or woman among you two eyes or two hands And they answered me saying No not one There is none whole save such as are yet too young to read the Scripture and to understand its commandment And when we had come out of the temple I straightway left that Blessed City for I was not too young and I could read the scripture The Good God and the Evil God The Good God and the Evil God met on the mountain top The Good God said Good day to you brother The Evil God did not answer And the Good God said You are in a bad humour today Yes said the Evil God for of late I have been often mistaken for you called by your name and treated as if I were you and it illpleases me And the Good God said But I too have been mistaken for you and called by your name The Evil God walked away cursing the stupidity of man Defeat Defeat my Defeat my solitude and my aloofness You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs And sweeter to my heart than all worldglory Defeat my Defeat my selfknowledge and my defiance Through you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot And not to be trapped by withering laurels And in you I have found aloneness And the joy of being shunned and scorned Defeat my Defeat my shining sword and shield In your eyes I have read That to be enthroned is to be enslaved And to be understood is to be leveled down And to be grasped is but to reach ones fullness And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed Defeat my Defeat my bold companion You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings And urging of seas And of mountains that burn in the night And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul Defeat my Defeat my deathless courage You and I shall laugh together with the storm And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us And we shall stand in the sun with a will And we shall be dangerous Night and the Madman I am like thee O Night dark and naked I walk on the flaming path which is above my daydreams and whenever my foot touches earth a giant oak tree comes forth Nay thou art not like me O Madman for thou still lookest backward to see how large a footprint thou leavest on the sand I am like thee O Night silent and deep and in the heart of my loneliness lies a Goddess in childbed and in him who is being born Heaven touches Hell Nay thou art not like me O Madman for thou shudderest yet before pain and the song of the abyss terrifies thee I am like thee O Night wild and terrible for my ears are crowded with cries of conquered nations and sighs for forgotten lands Nay thou art not like me O Madman for thou still takest thy littleself for a comrade and with thy monsterself thou canst not be friend I am like thee O Night cruel and awful for my bosom is lit by burning ships at sea and my lips are wet with blood of slain warriors Nay thou art not like me O Madman for the desire for a sisterspirit is yet upon thee and thou has not become alone unto thyself I am like thee O Night joyous and glad for he who dwells in my shadow is now drunk with virgin wine and she who follows me is sinning mirthfully Nay thou art not like me O Madman for thy soul is wrapped in the veil of seven folds and thou holdest not thy heart in thine hand I am like thee O Night patient and passionate for in my breast a thousand dead lovers are buried in shrouds of withered kisses Yea Madman art thou like me Art thou like me And canst thou ride the tempest as a steed and grasp the lightning as a sword Like thee O Night like thee mighty and high and my throne is built upon heaps of fallen Gods and before me too pass the days to kiss the hem of my garment but never to gaze at my face Art thou like me child of my darkest heart And dost thou think my untamed thoughts and speak my vast language Yea we are twin brothers O Night for thou revealest space and I reveal my soul Faces I have seen a face with a thousand countenances and a face that was but a single countenance as if held in a mould I have seen a face whose sheen I could look through to the ugliness beneath and a face whose sheen I had to lift to see how beautiful it was I have seen an old face much lined with nothing and a smooth face in which all things were graven I know faces because I look through the fabric my own eye weaves and behold the reality beneath The Greater Sea My soul and I went to the great sea to bathe And when we reached the shore we went about looking for a hidden and lonely place But as we walked we saw a man sitting on a grey rock taking pinches of salt from a bag and throwing them into the sea This is the pessimist said my soul Let us leave this place We cannot bathe here We walked on until we reached an inlet There we saw standing on a white rock a man holding a bejeweled box from which he took sugar and threw it into the sea And this is the optimist said my soul And he too must not see our naked bodies Further on we walked And on a beach we saw a man picking up dead fish and tenderly putting them back into the water And we cannot bathe before him said my soul He is the humane philanthropist And we passed on Then we came where we saw a man tracing his shadow on the sand Great waves came and erased it But he went on tracing it again and again He is the mystic said my soul Let us leave him And we walked on till in a quiet cover we saw a man scooping up the foam and putting it into an alabaster bowl He is the idealist said my soul Surely he must not see our nudity And on we walked Suddenly we heard a voice crying This is the sea This is the deep sea This is the vast and mighty sea And when we reached the voice it was a man whose back was turned to the sea and at his ear he held a shell listening to its murmur And my soul said Let us pass on He is the realist who turns his back on the whole he cannot grasp and busies himself with a fragment So we passed on And in a weedy place among the rocks was a man with his head buried in the sand And I said to my soul We can bath here for he cannot see us Nay said my soul For he is the most deadly of them all He is the puritan Then a great sadness came over the face of my soul and into her voice Let us go hence she said For there is no lonely hidden place where we can bathe I would not have this wind lift my golden hair or bare my white bosom in this air or let the light disclose my sacred nakedness Then we left that sea to seek the Greater Sea Crucified I cried to men I would be crucified And they said Why should your blood be upon our heads And I answered How else shall you be exalted except by crucifying madmen And they heeded and I was crucified And the crucifixion appeased me And when I was hanged between earth and heaven they lifted up their heads to see me And they were exalted for their heads had never before been lifted But as they stood looking up at me one called out For what art thou seeking to atone And another cried In what cause dost thou sacrifice thyself And a third said Thinkest thou with this price to buy world glory Then said a fourth Behold how he smiles Can such pain be forgiven And I answered them all and said Remember only that I smiled I do not atonenor sacrificenor wish for glory and I have nothing to forgive I thirstedand I besought you to give me my blood to drink For what is there can quench a madmans thirst but his own blood I was dumband I asked wounds of you for mouths I was imprisoned in your days and nightsand I sought a door into larger days and nights And now I goas others already crucified have gone And think not we are weary of crucifixion For we must be crucified by larger and yet larger men between greater earths and greater heavens The Astronomer In the shadow of the temple my friend and I saw a blind man sitting alone And my friend said Behold the wisest man of our land Then I left my friend and approached the blind man and greeted him And we conversed After a while I said Forgive my question but since when has thou been blind From my birth he answered Said I And what path of wisdom followest thou Said he I am an astronomer Then he placed his hand upon his breast saying I watch all these suns and moons and stars The Great Longing Here I sit between my brother the mountain and my sister the sea We three are one in loneliness and the love that binds us together is deep and strong and strange Nay it is deeper than my sisters depth and stronger than my brothers strength and stranger than the strangeness of my madness Aeons upon aeons have passed since the first grey dawn made us visible to one another and though we have seen the birth and the fullness and the death of many worlds we are still eager and young We are young and eager and yet we are mateless and unvisited and though we lie in unbroken half embrace we are uncomforted And what comfort is there for controlled desire and unspent passion Whence shall come the flaming god to warm my sisters bed And what shetorrent shall quench my brothers fire And who is the woman that shall command my heart In the stillness of the night my sister murmurs in her sleep the firegods unknown name and my brother calls afar upon the cool and distant goddess But upon whom I call in my sleep I know not Here I sit between my brother the mountain and my sister the sea We three are one in loneliness and the love that binds us together is deep and strong and strange Said a Blade of Grass Said a blade of grass to an autumn leaf You make such a noise falling You scatter all my winter dreams Said the leaf indignant Lowborn and lowdwelling Songless peevish thing You live not in the upper air and you cannot tell the sound of singing Then the autumn leaf lay down upon the earth and slept And when spring came she waked againand she was a blade of grass And when it was autumn and her winter sleep was upon her and above her through all the air the leaves were falling she muttered to herself O these autumn leaves They make such noise They scatter all my winter dreams The Eye Said the Eye one day I see beyond these valleys a mountain veiled with blue mist Is it not beautiful The Ear listened and after listening intently awhile said But where is any mountain I do not hear it Then the Hand spoke and said I am trying in vain to feel it or touch it and I can find no mountain And the Nose said There is no mountain I cannot smell it Then the Eye turned the other way and they all began to talk together about the Eyes strange delusion And they said Something must be the matter with the Eye The Two Learned Men Once there lived in the ancient city of Afkar two learned men who hated and belittled each others learning For one of them denied the existence of the gods and the other was a believer One day the two met in the marketplace and amidst their followers they began to dispute and to argue about the existence or the nonexistence of the gods And after hours of contention they parted That evening the unbeliever went to the temple and prostrated himself before the altar and prayed the gods to forgive his wayward past And the same hour the other learned man he who had upheld the gods burned his sacred books For he had become an unbeliever When My Sorrow Was Born When my Sorrow was born I nursed it with care and watched over it with loving tenderness And my Sorrow grew like all living things strong and beautiful and full of wondrous delights And we loved one another my Sorrow and I and we loved the world about us for Sorrow had a kindly heart and mine was kindly with Sorrow And when we conversed my Sorrow and I our days were winged and our nights were girdled with dreams for Sorrow had an eloquent tongue and mine was eloquent with Sorrow And when we sang together my Sorrow and I our neighbors sat at their windows and listened for our songs were deep as the sea and our melodies were full of strange memories And when we walked together my Sorrow and I people gazed at us with gentle eyes and whispered in words of exceeding sweetness And there were those who looked with envy upon us for Sorrow was a noble thing and I was proud with Sorrow But my Sorrow died like all living things and alone I am left to muse and ponder And now when I speak my words fall heavily upon my ears And when I sing my songs my neighbours come not to listen And when I walk the streets no one looks at me Only in my sleep I hear voices saying in pity See there lies the man whose Sorrow is dead And When my Joy was Born And when my Joy was born I held it in my arms and stood on the housetop shouting Come ye my neighbours come and see for Joy this day is born unto me Come and behold this gladsome thing that laugheth in the sun But none of my neighbours came to look upon my Joy and great was my astonishment And every day for seven moons I proclaimed my Joy from the housetopand yet no one heeded me And my Joy and I were alone unsought and unvisited Then my Joy grew pale and weary because no other heart but mine held its loveliness and no other lips kissed its lips Then my Joy died of isolation And now I only remember my dead Joy in remembering my dead Sorrow But memory is an autumn leaf that murmurs a while in the wind and then is heard no more The Perfect World God of lost souls thou who are lost amongst the gods hear me Gentle Destiny that watchest over us mad wandering spirits hear me I dwell in the midst of a perfect race I the most imperfect I a human chaos a nebula of confused elements I move amongst finished worldspeoples of complete laws and pure order whose thoughts are assorted whose dreams are arranged and whose visions are enrolled and registered Their virtues O God are measured their sins are weighed and even the countless things that pass in the dim twilight of neither sin nor virtue are recorded and catalogued Here days and night are divided into seasons of conduct and governed by rules of blameless accuracy To eat to drink to sleep to cover ones nudity and then to be weary in due time To work to play to sing to dance and then to lie still when the clock strikes the hour To think thus to feel thus much and then to cease thinking and feeling when a certain star rises above yonder horizon To rob a neighbour with a smile to bestow gifts with a graceful wave of the hand to praise prudently to blame cautiously to destroy a sound with a word to burn a body with a breath and then to wash the hands when the days work is done To love according to an established order to entertain ones best self in a preconceived manner to worship the gods becomingly to intrigue the devils artfullyand then to forget all as though memory were dead To fancy with a motive to contemplate with consideration to be happy sweetly to suffer noblyand then to empty the cup so that tomorrow may fill it again All these things O God are conceived with forethought born with determination nursed with exactness governed by rules directed by reason and then slain and buried after a prescribed method And even their silent graves that lie within the human soul are marked and numbered It is a perfect world a world of consummate excellence a world of supreme wonders the ripest fruit in Gods garden the masterthought of the universe But why should I be here O God I a green seed of unfulfilled passion a mad tempest that seeketh neither east nor west a bewildered fragment from a burnt planet Why am I here O God of lost souls thou who art lost amongst the gods You are your own forerunner and the towers you have builded are but the foundation of your giantself And that self too shall be a foundation And I too am my own forerunner for the long shadow stretching before me at sunrise shall gather under my feet at the noon hour Yet another sunrise shall lay another shadow before me and that also shall be gathered at another noon Always have we been our own forerunners and always shall we be And all that we have gathered and shall gather shall be but seeds for fields yet unploughed We are the fields and the ploughmen the gatherers and the gathered When you were a wandering desire in the mist I too was there a wandering desire Then we sought one another and out of our eagerness dreams were born And dreams were time limitless and dreams were space without measure And when you were a silent word upon Life’s quivering lips I too was there another silent word Then Life uttered us and we came down the years throbbing with memories of yesterday and with longing for tomorrow for yesterday was death conquered and tomorrow was birth pursued And now we are in God’s hands You are a sun in His right hand and I an earth in His left hand Yet you are not more shining than I shone upon And we sun and earth are but the beginning of a greater sun and a greater earth And always shall we be the beginning You are your own forerunner you the stranger passing by the gate of my garden And I too am my own forerunner though I sit in the shadows of my trees and seem motionless GOD’S FOOL Once there came from the desert to the great city of Sharia a man who was a dreamer and he had naught but his garment and a staff And as he walked through the streets he gazed with awe and wonder at the temples and towers and palaces for the city of Sharia was of surpassing beauty And he spoke often to the passersby questioning them about their citybut they understood not his language nor he their language At the noon hour he stopped before a vast inn It was built of yellow marble and people were going in and coming out unhindered “This must be a shrine” he said to himself and he too went in But what was his surprise to find himself in a hall of great splendour and a large company of men and women seated about many tables They were eating and drinking and listening to the musicians “Nay” said the dreamer “This is no worshipping It must be a feast given by the prince to the people in celebration of a great event” At that moment a man whom he took to be the slave of the prince approached him and bade him be seated And he was served with meat and wine and most excellent sweets When he was satisfied the dreamer rose to depart At the door he was stopped by a large man magnificently arrayed “Surely this is the prince himself” said the dreamer in his heart and he bowed to him and thanked him Then the large man said in the language of the city “Sir you have not paid for your dinner” And the dreamer did not understand and again thanked him heartily Then the large man bethought him and he looked more closely upon the dreamer And he saw that he was a stranger clad in but a poor garment and that indeed he had not wherewith to pay for his meal Then the large man clapped his hands and calledand there came four watchmen of the city And they listened to the large man Then they took the dreamer between them and they were two on each side of him And the dreamer noted the ceremoniousness of their dress and of their manner and he looked upon them with delight “These” said he “are men of distinction” And they walked all together until they came to the House of Judgment and they entered The dreamer saw before him seated upon a throne a venerable man with flowing beard robed majestically And he thought he was the king And he rejoiced to be brought before him Now the watchmen related to the judge who was the venerable man the charge against the dreamer and the judge appointed two advocates one to present the charge and the other to defend the stranger And the advocates rose the one after the other and delivered each his argument And the dreamer thought himself to be listening to addresses of welcome and his heart filled with gratitude to the king and the prince for all that was done for him Then sentence was passed upon the dreamer that upon a tablet hung about his neck his crime should be written and that he should ride through the city on a naked horse with a trumpeter and a drummer before him And the sentence was carried out forthwith Now as the dreamer rode through the city upon the naked horse with the trumpeter and the drummer before him the inhabitants of the city came running forth at the sound of the noise and when they saw him they laughed one and all and the children ran after him in companies from street to street And the dreamer’s heart was filled with ecstasy and his eyes shone upon them For to him the tablet was a sign of the king’s blessing and the procession was in his honour Now as he rode he saw among the crowd a man who was from the desert like himself and his heart swelled with joy and he cried out to him with a shout “Friend Friend Where are we What city of the heart’s desire is this What race of lavish hostswho feast the chance guest in their palaces whose princes companion him whose king hangs a token upon his breast and opens to him the hospitality of a city descended from heaven” And he who was also of the desert replied not He only smiled and slightly shook his head And the procession passed on And the dreamer’s face was uplifted and his eyes were overflowing with light LOVE They say the jackal and the mole Drink from the selfsame stream Where the lion comes to drink And they say the eagle and the vulture Dig their beaks into the same carcass And are at peace one with the other In the presence of the dead thing O love whose lordly hand Has bridled my desires And raised my hunger and my thirst To dignity and pride Let not the strong in me and the constant Eat the bread or drink the wine That tempt my weaker self Let me rather starve And let my heart parch with thirst And let me die and perish Ere I stretch my hand To a cup you did not fill Or a bowl you did not bless THE KINGHERMIT They told me that in a forest among the mountains lives a young man in solitude who once was a king of a vast country beyond the Two Rivers And they also said that he of his own will had left his throne and the land of his glory and come to dwell in the wilderness And I said “I would seek that man and learn the secret of his heart for he who renounces a kingdom must needs be greater than a kingdom” On that very day I went to the forest where he dwells And I found him sitting under a white cypress and in his hand a reed as if it were a sceptre And I greeted him even as I would greet a king And he turned to me and said gently “What would you in this forest of serenity Seek you a lost self in the green shadows or is it a homecoming in your twilight” And I answered “I sought but youfor I fain would know that which made you leave a kingdom for a forest” And he said “Brief is my story for sudden was the bursting of the bubble It happened thus One day as I sat at a window in my palace my chamberlain and an envoy from a foreign land were walking in my garden And as they approached my window the lord chamberlain was speaking of himself and saying ‘I am like the king I have a thirst for strong wine and a hunger for all games of chance And like my lord the king I have storms of temper’ And the lord chamberlain and the envoy disappeared among the trees But in a few minutes they returned and this time the lord chamberlain was speaking of me and he was saying ‘My lord the king is like myselfa good marksman and like me he loves music and bathes thrice a day’” After a moment he added “On the eve of that day I left my palace with but my garment for I would no longer be ruler over those who assume my vices and attribute to me their virtues” And I said “This is indeed a wonder and passing strange” And he said “Nay my friend you knocked at the gate of my silences and received but a trifle For who would not leave a kingdom for a forest where the seasons sing and dance ceaselessly Many are those who have given their kingdom for less than solitude and the sweet fellowship of aloneness Countless are the eagles who descend from the upper air to live with moles that they may know the secrets of the earth There are those who renounce the kingdom of dreams that they may not seem distant from the dreamless And those who renounce the kingdom of nakedness and cover their souls that others may not be ashamed in beholding truth uncovered and beauty unveiled And greater yet than all of these is he who renounces the kingdom of sorrow that he may not seem proud and vainglorious” Then rising he leaned upon his reed and said “Go now to the great city and sit at its gate and watch all those who enter into it and those who go out And see that you find him who though born a king is without kingdom and him who though ruled in flesh rules in spiritthough neither he nor his subjects know this and him also who but seems to rule yet is in truth slave of his own slaves” After he had said these things he smiled on me and there were a thousand dawns upon his lips Then he turned and walked away into the heart of the forest And I returned to the city and I sat at its gate to watch the passersby even as he had told me And from that day to this numberless are the kings whose shadows have passed over me and few are the subjects over whom my shadow has passed THE LION’S DAUGHTER Four slaves stood fanning an old queen who was asleep upon her throne And she was snoring And upon the queen’s lap a cat lay purring and gazing lazily at the slaves The first slave spoke and said “How ugly this old woman is in her sleep See her mouth droop and she breathes as if the devil were choking her” Then the cat said purring “Not half so ugly in her sleep as you in your waking slavery” And the second slave said “You would think sleep would smooth her wrinkles instead of deepening them She must be dreaming of something evil” And the cat purred “Would that you Illustration drawing signed K Gibran might sleep also and dream of your freedom” And the third slave said “Perhaps she is seeing the procession of all those that she has slain” And the cat purred “Aye she sees the procession of your forefathers and your descendants” And the fourth slave said “It is all very well to talk about her but it does not make me less weary of standing and fanning” And the cat purred “You shall be fanning to all eternity for as it is on earth so it is in heaven” At this moment the old queen nodded in her sleep and her crown fell to the floor And one of the slaves said “That is a bad omen” And the cat purred “The bad omen of one is the good omen of another” And the second slave said “What if she should wake and find her crown fallen She would surely slay us” And the cat purred “Daily from your birth she has slain you and you know it not” And the third slave said “Yes she would slay us and she would call it making sacrifice to the gods” And the cat purred “Only the weak are sacrificed to the gods” And the fourth slave silenced the others and softly he picked up the crown and replaced it without waking her on the old queen’s head And the cat purred “Only a slave restores a crown that has fallen” And after a while the old queen woke and she looked about her and yawned Then she said “Methought I dreamed and I saw four caterpillars chased by a scorpion around the trunk of an ancient oaktree I like not my dream” Then she closed her eyes and went to sleep again And she snored And the four slaves went on fanning her And the cat purred “Fan on fan on stupids You fan but the fire that consumes you” TYRANNY Thus sings the SheDragon that guards the seven caves by the sea “My mate shall come riding on the waves His thundering roar shall fill the earth with fear and the flames of his nostrils shall set the sky afire At the eclipse of the moon we shall be wedded and at the eclipse of the sun I shall give birth to a Saint George who shall slay me” Thus sings the SheDragon that guards the seven caves by the sea THE SAINT In my youth I once visited a saint in his silent grove beyond the hills and as we were conversing upon the nature of virtue a brigand came limping wearily up the ridge When he reached the grove he knelt down before the saint and said “O saint I would be comforted My sins are heavy upon me” And the saint replied “My sins too are heavy upon me” And the brigand said “But I am a thief and a plunderer” And the saint replied “I too am a thief and a plunderer” And the brigand said “But I am a murderer and the blood of many men cries in my ears” And the saint replied “I too am a murderer and in my ears cries the blood of many men” And the brigand said “I have committed countless crimes” And the saint replied “I too have committed crimes without number” Then the brigand stood up and gazed at the saint and there was a strange look in his eyes And when he left us he went skipping down the hill And I turned to the saint and said “Wherefore did you accuse yourself of uncommitted crimes See you not that this man went away no longer believing in you” And the saint answered “It is true he no longer believes in me But he went away much comforted” At that moment we heard the brigand singing in the distance and the echo of his song filled the valley with gladness THE PLUTOCRAT In my wanderings I once saw upon an island a manheaded ironhoofed monster who ate of the earth and drank of the sea incessantly And for a long while I watched him Then I approached him and said “Have you never enough is your hunger never satisfied and your thirst never quenched” And he answered saying “Yes I am satisfied nay I am weary of eating and drinking but I am afraid that tomorrow there will be no more earth to eat and no more sea to drink” THE GREATER SELF This came to pass After the coronation of Nufsibaäl King of Byblus he retired to his bed chamberthe very room which the three hermitmagicians of the mountain had built for him He took off his crown and his royal raiment and stood in the centre of the room thinking of himself now the allpowerful ruler of Byblus Suddenly he turned and he saw stepping out of the silver mirror which his mother had given him a naked man The king was startled and he cried out to the man “What would you” And the naked man answered “Naught but this Why have they crowned you king” And the king answered “Because I am the noblest man in the land” Then the naked man said “If you were still more noble you would not be king” And the king said “Because I am the mightiest man in the land they crowned me” And the naked man said “If you were mightier yet you would not be king” Then the king said “Because I am the wisest man they crowned me king” And the naked man said “If you were still wiser you would not choose to be king” Then the king fell to the floor and wept bitterly The naked man looked down upon him Then he took up the crown and with tenderness replaced it upon the king’s bent head And the naked man gazing lovingly upon the king entered into the mirror And the king roused and straightway he looked into the mirror And he saw there but himself crowned WAR AND THE SMALL NATIONS Once high above a pasture where a sheep and a lamb were grazing an eagle was circling and gazing hungrily down upon the lamb And as he was about to descend and seize his prey another eagle appeared and hovered above the sheep and her young with the same hungry intent Then the two rivals began to fight filling the sky with their fierce cries The sheep looked up and was much astonished She turned to the lamb and said “How strange my child that these two noble birds should attack one another Is not the vast sky large enough for both of them Pray my little one pray in your heart that God may make peace between your winged brothers” And the lamb prayed in his heart Illustration drawing signed K Gibran CRITICS One nightfall a man travelling on horseback toward the sea reached an inn by the roadside He dismounted and confident in man and night like all riders toward the sea he tied his horse to a tree beside the door and entered into the inn At midnight when all were asleep a thief came and stole the traveller’s horse In the morning the man awoke and discovered that his horse was stolen And he grieved for his horse and that a man had found it in his heart to steal Then his fellowlodgers came and stood around him and began to talk And the first man said “How foolish of you to tie your horse outside the stable” And the second said “Still more foolish without even hobbling the horse” And the third man said “It is stupid at best to travel to the sea on horseback” And the fourth said “Only the indolent and the slow of foot own horses” Then the traveller was much astonished At last he cried “My friends because my horse is stolen you have hastened one and all to tell me my faults and my shortcomings But strange not one word of reproach have you uttered about the man who stole my horse” POETS Four poets were sitting around a bowl of punch that stood on a table Said the first poet “Methinks I see with my third eye the fragrance of this wine hovering in space like a cloud of birds in an enchanted forest” The second poet raised his head and said “With my inner ear I can hear those mistbirds singing And the melody holds my heart as the white rose imprisons the bee within her petals” The third poet closed his eyes and stretched his arm upward and said “I touch them with my hand I feel their wings like the breath of a sleeping fairy brushing against my fingers” Then the fourth poet rose and lifted up the bowl and he said “Alas friends I am too dull of sight and of hearing and of touch I cannot see the fragrance of this wine nor hear its song nor feel the beating of its wings I perceive but the wine itself Now therefore must I drink it that it may sharpen my senses and raise me to your blissful heights” And putting the bowl to his lips he drank the punch to the very last drop The three poets with their mouths open looked at him aghast and there was a thirsty yet unlyrical hatred in their eyes THE WEATHERCOCK Said the weathercock to the wind “How tedious and monotonous you are Can you not blow any other way but in my face You disturb my Godgiven stability” And the wind did not answer It only laughed in space THE KING OF ARADUS Once the elders of the city of Aradus presented themselves before the king and besought of him a decree to forbid to men all wine and all intoxicants within their city And the king turned his back upon them and went out from them laughing Then the elders departed in dismay At the door of the palace they met the lord chamberlain And the lord chamberlain observed that they were troubled and he understood their case Then he said “Pity my friends Had you found the king drunk surely he would have granted you your petition” OUT OF MY DEEPER HEART Out of my deeper heart a bird rose and flew skyward Higher and higher did it rise yet larger and larger did it grow At first it was but like a swallow then a lark then an eagle then as vast as a spring cloud and then it filled the starry heavens Out of my heart a bird flew skyward And it waxed larger as it flew Yet it left not my heart O my faith my untamed knowledge how shall I fly to your height and see with you man’s larger self pencilled upon the sky How shall I turn this sea within me into mist and move with you in space immeasurable How can a prisoner within the temple behold its golden domes How shall the heart of a fruit be stretched to envelop the fruit also O my faith I am in chains behind these bars of silver and ebony and I cannot fly with you Yet out of my heart you rise skyward and it is my heart that holds you and I shall be content Illustration drawing signed K Gibran DYNASTIES The Queen of Ishana was in travail of childbirth and the King and the mighty men of his court were waiting in breathless anxiety in the great hall of the Winged Bulls At eventide there came suddenly a messenger in haste and prostrated himself before the King and said “I bring glad tidings unto my lord the King and unto the kingdom and the slaves of the King Mihrab the Cruel thy lifelong enemy the King of Bethroun is dead” When the King and the mighty men heard this they all rose and shouted for joy for the powerful Mihrab had he lived longer had assuredly overcome Ishana and carried the inhabitants captive At this moment the court physician also entered the hall of Winged Bulls and behind him came the royal midwives And the physician prostrated himself before the king and said “My lord the King shall live for ever and through countless generations shall he rule over the people of Ishana For unto thee O King is born this very hour a son who shall be thy heir” Then indeed was the soul of the King intoxicated with joy that in the same moment his foe was dead and the royal line was established Now in the City of Ishana lived a true prophet And the prophet was young and bold of spirit And the King that very night ordered that the prophet should be brought before him And when he was brought the King said unto him “Prophesy now and foretell what shall be the future of my son who is this day born unto the kingdom” And the prophet hesitated not but said “Hearken O King and I will indeed prophesy of the future of thy son that is this day born The soul of thy enemy even of thy enemy King Mihrab who died yestereve lingered but a day upon the wind Then it sought for itself a body to enter into And that which it entered into was the body of thy son that is born unto thee this hour” Then the King was enraged and with his sword he slew the prophet And from that day to this the wise men of Ishana say one to another secretly “Is it not known and has it not been said from of old that Ishana is ruled by an enemy” KNOWLEDGE AND HALFKNOWLEDGE Four frogs sat upon a log that lay floating on the edge of a river Suddenly the log was caught by the current and swept slowly down the stream The frogs were delighted and absorbed for never before had they sailed At length the first frog spoke and said “This is indeed a most marvellous log It moves as if alive No such log was ever known before” Then the second frog spoke and said “Nay my friend the log is like other logs and does not move It is the river that is walking to the sea and carries us and the log with it” And the third frog spoke and said “It is neither the log nor the river that moves The moving is in our thinking For without thought nothing moves” And the three frogs began to wrangle about what was really moving The quarrel grew hotter and louder but they could not agree Then they turned to the fourth frog who up to this time had been listening attentively but holding his peace and they asked his opinion And the fourth frog said “Each of you is right and none of you is wrong The moving is in the log and the water and our thinking also” And the three frogs became very angry for none of them was willing to admit that his was not the whole truth and that the other two were not wholly wrong Then the strange thing happened The three frogs got together and pushed the fourth frog off the log into the river “SAID A SHEET OF SNOWWHITE PAPER” Said a sheet of snowwhite paper “Pure was I created and pure will I remain for ever I would rather be burnt and turn to white ashes than suffer darkness to touch me or the unclean to come near me” The inkbottle heard what the paper was saying and it laughed in its dark heart but it never dared to approach her And the multicoloured pencils heard her also and they too never came near her And the snowwhite sheet of paper did remain pure and chaste for everpure and chasteand empty THE SCHOLAR AND THE POET Said the serpent to the lark “Thou flyest yet thou canst not visit the recesses of the earth where the sap of life moveth in perfect silence” And the lark answered “Aye thou knowest over much nay thou art wiser than all things wisepity thou canst not fly” And as if he did not hear the serpent said “Thou canst not see the secrets of the deep nor move among the treasures of the hidden empire It was but yesterday I lay in a cave of rubies It is like the heart of a ripe pomegranate and the faintest ray of light turns it into a flamerose Who but me can behold such marvels” And the lark said “None none but thee can lie among the crystal memories of the cycles pity thou canst not sing” And the serpent said “I know a plant whose root descends to the bowels of the earth and he who eats of that root becomes fairer than Ashtarte” And the lark said “No one no one but thee could unveil the magic thought of the earthpity thou canst not fly” And the serpent said “There is a purple stream that runneth under a mountain and he who drinketh of it shall become immortal even as the gods Surely no bird or beast can discover that purple stream” And the lark answered “If thou willest thou canst become deathless even as the godspity thou canst not sing” And the serpent said “I know a buried temple which I visit once a moon It was built by a forgotten race of giants and upon its walls are graven the secrets of time and space and he who reads them shall understand that which passeth all understanding” And the lark said “Verily if thou so desirest thou canst encircle with thy pliant body all knowledge of time and spacepity thou canst not fly” Then the serpent was disgusted and as he turned and entered into his hole he muttered “Empty headed songster” And the lark flew away singing “Pity thou canst not sing Pity pity my wise one thou canst not fly” VALUES Once a man unearthed in his field a marble statue of great beauty And he took it to a collector who loved all beautiful things and offered it to him for sale and the collector bought it for a large price And they parted And as the man walked home with his money he thought and he said to himself “How much life this money means How can any one give all this for a dead carved stone buried and undreamed of in the earth for a thousand years” And now the collector was looking at his statue and he was thinking and he said to himself “What beauty What life The dream of what a souland fresh with the sweet sleep of a thousand years How can any one give all this for money dead and dreamless” OTHER SEAS A fish said to another fish “Above this sea of ours there is another sea with creatures swimming in itand they live there even as we live here” The fish replied “Pure fancy Pure fancy When you know that everything that leaves our sea by even an inch and stays out of it dies What proof have you of other lives in other seas” REPENTANCE On a moonless night a man entered into his neighbour’s garden and stole the largest melon he could find and brought it home He opened it and found it still unripe Then behold a marvel The man’s conscience woke and smote him with remorse and he repented having stolen the melon THE DYING MAN AND THE VULTURE Wait wait yet awhile my eager friend I shall yield but too soon this wasted thing Whose agony overwrought and useless Exhausts your patience I would not have your honest hunger Wait upon these moments But this chain though made of a breath Is hard to break And the will to die Stronger than all things strong Is stayed by a will to live Feebler than all things feeble Forgive me comrade I tarry too long It is memory that holds my spirit A procession of distant days A vision of youth spent in a dream A face that bids my eyelids not to sleep A voice that lingers in my ears A hand that touches my hand Forgive me that you have waited too long It is over now and all is faded The face the voice the hand and the mist that brought them hither The knot is untied The cord is cleaved And that which is neither food nor drink is withdrawn Approach my hungry comrade The board is made ready And the fare frugal and spare Is given with love Come and dig your beak here into the left side And tear out of its cage this smaller bird Whose wings can beat no more I would have it soar with you into the sky Come now my friend I am your host tonight And you my welcome guest BEYOND MY SOLITUDE Beyond my solitude is another solitude and to him who dwells therein my aloneness is a crowded marketplace and my silence a confusion of sounds Too young am I and too restless to seek that abovesolitude The voices of yonder valley still hold my ears and its shadows bar my way and I cannot go Beyond these hills is a grove of enchantment and to him who dwells therein my peace is but a whirlwind and my enchantment an illusion Too young am I and too riotous to seek that sacred grove The taste of blood is clinging in my mouth and the bow and the arrows of my fathers yet linger in my hand and I cannot go Beyond this burdened self lives my freer self and to him my dreams are a battle fought in twilight and my desires the rattling of bones Too young am I and too outraged to be my freer self And how shall I become my freer self unless I slay my burdened selves or unless all men become free How shall my leaves fly singing upon the wind unless my roots shall wither in the dark How shall the eagle in me soar against the sun until my fledglings leave the nest which I with my own beak have built for them THE LAST WATCH At the hightide of night when the first breath of dawn came upon the wind the Forerunner he who calls himself echo to a voice yet unheard left his bedchamber and ascended to the roof of his house Long he stood and looked down upon the slumbering city Then he raised his head and even as if the sleepless spirits of all those asleep had gathered around him he opened his lips and spoke and he said “My friends and my neighbours and you who daily pass my gate I would speak to you in your sleep and in the valley of your dreams I would walk naked and unrestrained far heedless are your waking hours and deaf are your soundburdened ears “Long did I love you and overmuch “I love the one among you as though he were all and all as if you were one And in the spring of my heart I sang in your gardens and in the summer of my heart I watched at your threshingfloors “Yea I loved you all the giant and the pigmy the leper and the anointed and him who gropes in the dark even as him who dances his days upon the mountains “You the strong have I loved though the marks of your iron hoofs are yet upon my flesh and you the weak though you have drained my faith and wasted my patience “You the rich have I loved while bitter was your honey to my mouth and you the poor though you knew my emptyhanded shame “You the poet with the barrowed lute and blind fingers you have I loved in self indulgence and you the scholar ever gathering rotted shrouds in potters’ fields “You the priest I have loved who sit in the silences of yesterday questioning the fate of my tomorrow and you the worshippers of gods the images of your own desires “You the thirsting woman whose cup is ever full I have loved you in understanding and you the woman of restless nights you too I have loved in pity “You the talkative have I loved saying ‘Life hath much to say’ and you the dumb have I loved whispering to myself ‘Says he not in silence that which I fain would hear in words’ “And you the judge and the critic I have loved also yet when you have seen me crucified you said ‘He bleeds rhythmically and the pattern his blood makes upon his white skin is beautiful to behold’ “Yea I have loved you all the young and the old the trembling reed and the oak “But alas it was the overabundance of my heart that turned you from me You would drink love from a cup but not from a surging river You would hear love’s faint murmur but when love shouts you would muffle your ears “And because I have loved you all you have said ‘Too soft and yielding is his heart and too undiscerning is his path It is the love of a needy one who picks crumbs even as he sits at kingly feasts And it is the love of a weakling for the strong loves only the strong’ “And because I have loved you overmuch you have said ‘It is but the love of a blind man who knows not the beauty of one nor the ugliness of another And it is the love of the tasteless who drinks vinegar even as wine And it is the love of the impertinent and the overweening for what stranger could be our mother and father and sister and brother’ “This you have said and more For often in the marketplace you pointed your fingers at me and said mockingly ‘There goes the ageless one the man without seasons who at the noon hour plays games with our children and at eventide sits with our elders and assumes wisdom and understanding’ “And I said ‘I will love them more Aye even more I will hide my love with seeming to hate and disguise my tenderness as bitterness I will wear an iron mask and only when armed and mailed shall I seek them’ “Then I laid a heavy hand upon your bruises and like a tempest in the night I thundered in your ears “From the housetop I proclaimed you hypocrites pharisees tricksters false and empty earthbubbles “The shortsighted among you I cursed for blind bats and those too near the earth I likened to soulless moles “The eloquent I pronounced forktongued the silent stonelipped and the simple and artless I called the dead never weary of death “The seekers after world knowledge I condemned as offenders of the holy spirit and those who would naught but the spirit I branded as hunters of shadows who cast their nets in flat waters and catch but their own images “Thus with my lips have I denounced you while my heart bleeding within me called you tender names “It was love lashed by its own self that spoke It was pride half slain that fluttered in the dust It was my hunger for your love that raged from the housetop while my own love kneeling in silence prayed your forgiveness “But behold a miracle “It was my disguise that opened your eyes and my seeming to hate that woke your hearts “And now you love me “You love the swords that strike you and the arrows that crave your breast For it comforts you to be wounded and only when you drink of your own blood can you be intoxicated “Like moths that seek destruction in the flame you gather daily in my garden and with faces uplifted and eyes enchanted you watch me tear the fabric of your days And in whispers you say the one to the other ‘He sees with the light of God He speaks like the prophets of old He unveils our souls and unlocks our hearts and like the eagle that knows the way of foxes he knows our ways’ “Aye in truth I know your ways but only as an eagle knows the ways of his fledglings And I fain would disclose my secret Yet in my need for your nearness I feign remoteness and in fear of the ebbtide of your love I guard the floodgates of my love” After saying these things the Forerunner covered his face with his hands and wept bitterly For he knew in his heart that love humiliated in its nakedness is greater than love that seeks triumph in disguise and he was ashamed But suddenly he raised his head and like one waking from sleep he outstretched his arms and said “Night is over and we children of night must die when dawn comes leaping upon the hills and out of our ashes a mightier love shall rise And it shall laugh in the sun and it shall be deathless” My neighbors you remember the dawn of youth with pleasure and regret its passing but I remember it like a prisoner who recalls the bars and shackles of his jail You speak of those years between infancy and youth as a golden era free from confinement and cares but I call those years an era of silent sorrow which dropped as a seed into my heart and grew with it and could find no outlet to the world of Knowledge and wisdom until love came and opened the hearts doors and lighted its corners Love provided me with a tongue and tears You people remember the gardens and orchids and the meeting places and street corners that witnessed your games and heard your innocent whispering and I remember too the beautiful spot in North Lebanon Every time I close my eyes I see those valleys full of magic and dignity and those mountains covered with glory and greatness trying to reach the sky Every time I shut my ears to the clamor of the city I hear the murmur of the rivulets and the rustling of the branches All those beauties which I speak of now and which I long to see as a child longs for his mothers breast wounded my spirit imprisoned in the darkness of youth as a falcon suffers in its cage when it sees a flock of birds flying freely in the spacious sky Those valleys and hills fired my imagination but bitter thoughts wove round my heart a net of hopelessness Every time I went to the fields I returned disappointed without understanding the cause of my disappointment Every time I looked at the gray sky I felt my heart contract Every time I heard the singing of the birds and babbling of the spring I suffered without understanding the reason for my suffering It is said that unsophistication makes a man empty and that emptiness makes him carefree It may be true among those who were born dead and who exist like frozen corpses but the sensitive boy who feels much and knows little is the most unfortunate creature under the sun because he is torn by two forces the first force elevates him and shows him the beauty of existence through a cloud of dreams the second ties him down to the earth and fills his eyes with dust and overpowers him with fears and darkness Solitude has soft silky hands but with strong fingers it grasps the heart and makes it ache with sorrow Solitude is the ally of sorrow as well as a companion of spiritual exaltation The boys soul undergoing the buffeting of sorrow is like a white lily just unfolding It trembles before the breeze and opens its heart to daybreak and folds its leaves back when the shadow of night comes If that boy does not have diversion or friends or companions in his games his life will be like a narrow prison in which he sees nothing but spiderwebs and hears nothing but the crawling of insects That sorrow which obsessed me during my youth was not caused by lack of amusement because I could have had it neither from lack of friends because I could have found them That sorrow was caused by an inward ailment which made me love solitude It killed in me the inclination for games and amusement It removed from my shoulders the wings of youth and made me like a pong of water between mountains which reflects in its calm surface the shadows of ghosts and the colors of clouds and trees but cannot find an outlet by which to pass singing to the sea Thus was my life before I attained the age of eighteen That year is like a mountain peak in my life for it awakened knowledge in me and made me understand the vicissitudes of mankind In that year I was reborn and unless a person is born again his life will remain like a blank sheet in the book of existence In that year I saw the angels of heaven looking at me through the eyes of a beautiful woman I also saw the devils of hell raging in the heart of an evil man He who does not see the angels and devils in the beauty and malice of life will be far removed from knowledge and his spirit will be empty of affection In the spring of the that wonderful year I was in Beirut The gardens were full of Nisan flowers and the earth was carpeted with green grass and like a secret of earth revealed to Heaven The orange trees and apple trees looking like houris or brides sent by nature to inspire poets and excite the imagination were wearing white garments of perfumed blossoms Spring is beautiful everywhere but it is most beautiful in Lebanon It is a spirit that roams round the earth but hovers over Lebanon conversing with kings and prophets singing with the rives the songs of Solomon and repeating with the Holy Cedars of Lebanon the memory of ancient glory Beirut free from the mud of winter and the dust of summer is like a bride in the spring or like a mermaid sitting by the side of a brook drying her smooth skin in the rays of the sun One day in the month of Nisan I went to visit a friend whose home was at some distance from the glamorous city As we were conversing a dignified man of about sixtyfive entered the house As I rose to greet him my friend introduced him to me as Farris Effandi Karamy and then gave him my name with flattering words The old man looked at me a moment touching his forehead with the ends of his fingers as if he were trying to regain his memory Then he smilingly approached me saying You are the son of a very dear friend of mine and I am happy to see that friend in your person Much affected by his words I was attracted to him like a bird whose instinct leads him to his nest before the coming of the tempest As we sat down he told us about his friendship with my father recalling the time which they spent together An old man likes to return in memory to the days of his youth like a stranger who longs to go back to his own country He delights to tell stories of the past like a poet who takes pleasure in reciting his best poem He lives spiritually in the past because the present passes swiftly and the future seems to him an approach to the oblivion of the grave An hour full of old memories passed like the shadows of the trees over the grass When Farris Effandi started to leave he put his left hand on my shoulder and shook my right hand saying I have not seen your father for twenty years I hope you will l take his place in frequent visits to my house I promised gratefully to do my duty toward a dear friend of my father When the old man left the house I asked my friend to tell me more about him He said I do not know any other man in Beirut whose wealth has made him kind and whose kindness has made him wealthy He is one of the few who come to this world and leave it without harming any one but people of that kind are usually miserable and oppressed because they are not clever enough to save themselves from the crookedness of others Farris Effandi has one daughter whose character is similar to his and whose beauty and gracefulness are beyond description and she will also be miserable because her fathers wealth is placing her already at the edge of a horrible precipice As he uttered these words I noticed that his face clouded Then he continued Farris Effandi is a good old man with a noble heart but he lacks will power People lead him like a blind man His daughter obeys him in spite of her pride and intelligence and this is the secret which lurks in the life of father and daughter This secret was discovered by an evil man who is a bishop and whose wickedness hides in the shadow of his Gospel He makes the people believe that he is kind and noble He is the head of religion in this land of the religions The people obey and worship him He leads them like a flock of lambs to the slaughter house This bishop has a nephew who is full of hatefulness and corruption The day will come sooner or later when he will place his nephew on his right and Farris Effandis daughter on this left and holding with his evil hand the wreath of matrimony over their heads will tie a pure virgin to a filthy degenerate placing the heart of the day in the bosom of the night That is all I can tell you about Farris Effandi and his daughter so do not ask me any more questions Saying this he turned his head toward the window as if he were trying to solve the problems of human existence by concentrating on the beauty of the universe As I left the house I told my friend that I was going to visit Farris Effandi in a few days for the purpose of fulfilling my promise and for the sake of the friendship which had joined him and my father He stared at me for a moment and I noticed a change in his expression as if my few simple words had revealed to him a new idea Then he looked straight through my eyes in a strange manner a look of love mercy and fear the look of a prophet who foresees what no one else can divine Then his lips trembled a little but he said nothing when I started towards the door That strange look followed me the meaning of which I could not understand until I grew up in the world of experience where hearts understand each other intuitively and where spirits are mature with knowledge In a few days loneliness overcame me and I tired of the grim faces of books I hired a carriage and started for the house of Farris Effandi As i reached the pine woods where people went for picnics the driver took a private way shaded with willow trees on each side Passing through we could see the beauty of the green grass the grapevines and the many colored flowers of Nisan just blossoming In a few minutes the carriage stopped before a solitary house in the midst of a beautiful garden The scent of roses gardenia and jasmine filled the air As I dismounted and entered the spacious garden I saw Farris Effandi coming to meet me He ushered me into his house with a hearty welcome and sat by me like a happy father when he sees his son showering me with questions on my life future and education I answered him my voice full of ambition and zeal for I heard ringing in my ears the hymn of glory and I was sailing the calm sea of hopeful dreams Just then a beautiful young woman dressed in a gorgeous white silk gown appeared from behind the velvet curtains of the door and walked toward me Farris Effandi and I rose from our seats This is my daughter Selma said the old man Then he introduced me to her saying Fate has brought back to me a dear old friend of mine in the person of his son Selma stared at me a moment as if doubting that a visitor could have entered their house Her hand when I touched it was like a white lily and a strange pang pierced my heart We all sat silent as if Selma had brought into the room with her heavenly spirit worthy of mute respect As she felt the silence she smiled at me and said Many a times my father has repeated to me the stories of his youth and of the old days he and your father spent together If your father spoke to you in the same way then this meeting is not the first one between us The old man was delighted to hear his daughter talking in such a manner and said Selma is very sentimental She sees everything through the eyes of the spirit Then he resumed his converstion with care and tact as if he had found in me a magic which took him on the wings of memory to the days of the past As I considered him dreaming of my own later years he looked upon me as a lofty old tree that has withstood storms and sunshine throws its shadow upon a small sapling which shakes before the breeze of dawn But Selma was silent Occasionally she looked first at me and then at her father as if reading the first and last chapters of lifes drama The day passed faster in that garden and I could see through the window the ghostly yellow kiss of sunset on the mountains of Lebanon Farris Effandi continued to recount his experiences and I listened entranced and responded with such enthusiasm that his sorrow was changed to happiness Selma sat by the window looking on with sorrowful eyes and not speaking although beauty has its own heavenly language loftier than the voices of tongues and lips It is a timeless language common to all humanity a calm lake that attracts the singing rivulets to its depth and makes them silent Only our spirits can understand beauty or live and grow with it It puzzles our minds we are unable to describe it in words it is a sensation that our eyes cannot see derived from both the one who observes and the one who is looked upon Real beauty is a ray which emanates from the holy of holies of the spirit and illuminates the body as life comes from the depths of the earth and gives color and scent to a flower Real beauty lies in the spiritual accord that is called love which can exist between a man and a woman Did my spirit and Selmas reach out to each other that day when we met and did that yearning make me see her as the most beautiful woman under the sun Or was I intoxicated with the wine of youth which made me fancy that which never existed Did my youth blind my natural eyes and make me imagine the brightness of her eyes the sweetness of her mouth and the grace of her figure Or was it that her brightness sweetness and grace opened my eyes and showed me the happiness and sorrow of love It is hard to answer these questions but I say truly that in that hour I felt an emotion that I had never felt before a new affection resting calmly in my heart like the spirit hovering over the waters at the creation of the world and from that affection was born my happiness and my sorrow Thus ended the hour of my first meeting with Selma and thus the will of Heaven freed me from the bondage of youth and solitude and let me walk in the procession of love Love is the only freedom in the world because it so elevates the spirit that the laws of humanity and the phenomena of nature do not alter its course As I rose from my seat to depart Farris Effandi came close to me and said soberly Now my son since you know your way to this house you should come often and feel that you are coming to your fathers house Consider me as a father and Selma as a sister Saying this he turned to Selma as if to ask confirmation of his statement She nodded her head positively and then looked at me as one who has found an old acquaintance Those words uttered by Farris Effandi Karamy placed me side by side with his daughter at the altar of love Those words were a heavenly song which started with exaltation and ended with sorrow they raised our spirits to the realm of light and searing flame they were the cup from which we drank happiness and bitterness I left the house The old man accompanied me to the edge of the garden while my heart throbbed like the trembling lips of a thirsty man The month of Nisan had nearly passed I continued to visit the home of Farris Effendi and to meet Selma in that beautiful garden gazing upon her beauty marveling at her intelligence and hearing the stillness of sorrow I felt an invisible hand drawing me to her Every visit gave me a new meaning to her beauty and a new insight into her sweet spirit Until she became a book whose pages I could understand and whose praises I could sing but which I could never finish reading A woman whom Providence has provided with beauty of spirit and body is a truth at the same time both open and secret which we can understand only by love and touch only by virtue and when we attempt to describe such a woman she disappears like vapor Selma Karamy had bodily and spiritual beauty but how can I describe her to one who never knew her Can a dead man remember the singing of a nightingale and the fragrance of a rose and the sigh of a brook Can a prisoner who is heavily loaded with shackles follow the breeze of the dawn Is not silence more painful than death Does pride prevent me from describing Selma in plain words since I cannot draw her truthfully with luminous colors A hungry man in a desert will not refuse to eat dry bread if Heaven does not shower him with manna and quails In her white silk dress Selma was slender as a ray of moonlight coming through the window She walked gracefully and rhythmically Her voice was low and sweet words fell from her lips like drops of dew falling from the petals of flowers when they are disturbed by the wind But Selmas face No words can describe its expression reflecting first great internal suffering then heavenly exaltation The beauty of Selmas face was not classic it was like a dream of revelation which cannot be measured or bound or copied by the brush of a painter or the chisel of a sculptor Selmas beauty was not in her golden hair but in the virtue of purity which surrounded it not in her large eyes but in the light which emanated from them not in her red lips but in the sweetness of her words not in her ivory neck but in its slight bow to the front Nor was it in her perfect figure but in the nobility of her spirit burning like a white torch between earth and sky Her beauty was like a gift of poetry But poets care unhappy people for no matter how high their spirits reach they will still be enclosed in an envelope of tears Selma was deeply thoughtful rather than talkative and her silence was a kind of music that carried one to a world of dreams and made him listen to the throbbing of his heart and see the ghosts of his thoughts and feelings standing before him looking him in the eyes She wore a cloak of deep sorrow through her life which increased her strange beauty and dignity as a tree in blossom is more lovely when seen through the mist of dawn Sorrow linked her spirit and mine as if each saw in the others face what the heart was feeling and heard the echo of a hidden voice God had made two bodies in one and separation could be nothing but agony The sorrowful spirit finds rest when united with a similar one They join affectionately as a stranger is cheered when he sees another stranger in a strange land Hearts that are united through the medium of sorrow will not be separated by the glory of happiness Love that is cleansed by tears will remain externally pure and beautiful One day Farris Effandi invited me to dinner at his home I accepted my spirit hungry for the divine bread which Heaven placed in the hands of Selma the spiritual bread which makes our hearts hungrier the more we eat of it It was this bread which Kais the Arabian poet Dante and Sappho tasted and which set their hearts afar the bread which the Goddess prepares with the sweetness of kisses and the bitterness of tears As I reached the home of Farris Effandi I saw Selma sitting on a bench in the garden resting her head against a tree and looking like a bride in her white silk dress or like a sentinel guarding that place Silently and reverently I approached and sat by her I could not talk so I resorted to silence the only language of the heart but I felt that Selma was listening to my wordless call and watching the ghost of my soul in my eyes In a few minutes the old man came out and greeted me as usual When he stretched his hand toward me I felt as if he were blessing the secrets that united me and his daughter Then he said Dinner is ready my children let us eat We rose and followed him and Selmas eyes brightened for a new sentiment had been added to her love by her fathers calling us his children We sat at the table enjoying the food and sipping the old wine but our souls were living in a world far away We were dreaming of the future and its hardships Three persons were separated in thoughts but united in love three innocent people with much feeling but little knowledge a drama was being performed by an old man who loved his daughter and cared for her happiness a young woman of twenty looking into the future with anxiety and a young man dreaming and worrying who had tasted neither the wine of life nor its vinegar and trying to reach the height of love and knowledge but unable to life himself up We three sitting in twilight were eating and drinking in that solitary home guarded by Heavens eyes but at the bottoms of our glasses were hidden bitterness and anguish As we finished eating one of the maids announced the presence of a man at the door who wished to see Farris Effandi Who is he asked the old man The Bishops messenger said the maid There was a moment of silence during which Farris Effandi stared at his daughter like a prophet who gazes at Heaven to divine its secret Then he said to the maid Let the man in As the maid left a man dressed in oriental uniform and with big mustache curled at the ends entered and greeted the old man saying His Grace the Bishop has sent me for you with his private carriage he wishes to discuss important business with you The old mans face clouded and his smile disappeared After a moment of deep thought he came close to me and said in a friendly voice I hope to find you here when I come back for Selma will enjoy your company in this solitary place Saying this he turned to Selma and smiling asked if she agreed She nodded her head but her cheeks became red and with a voice sweeter than the music of the lyre she said I will do my best Father to make our guest happy Selma watched the carriage that had taken her father and the Bishops messenger until it disappeared Then she came and sat opposite me on a divan covered with green silk She looked like a lily bent to the carpet of green grass by the breeze of dawn It was the will of Heaven that I should be with Selma alone at night in her beautiful home surrounded by trees where silence love beauty and virtue dwelt together We were both silent each waiting for the other to speak but speech is not the only means of understanding between two souls It is not the syllables that come from the lips and tongues that bring hearts together There is something greater and purer than what the mouth utters Silence illuminates our souls whispers to our hearts and brings them together Silence separates us from ourselves makes us sail the firmament of spirit and brings us closer to Heaven it makes us feel that bodies are no more than prisons and that this world is only a place of exile Selma looked at me and her eyes revealed the secret of her heart Then she quietly said Let us go to the garden and sit under the trees and watch the moon come up behind the mountains Obediently I rose from my seat but I hesitated Dont you think we had better stay here until the moon has risen and illuminates the garden And I continued The darkness hides the trees and flowers We can see nothing Then she said If darkness hides the trees and flowers from our eyes it will not hide love from our hearts Uttering these words in a strange tone she turned her eyes and looked through the window I remained silent pondering her words weighing the true meaning of each syllable Then she looked at me as if she regretted what she had said and tried to take away those words from my ears by the magic of her eyes But those eyes instead of making me forget what she had said repeated through the depths of my heart more clearly and effectively the sweet words which had already become graven in my memory for eternity Every beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man Every thing we see today made by past generation was before its appearance a thought in the mind of a man or an impulse in the heart of a woman The revolutions that shed so much blood and turned mens minds toward liberty were the idea of one man who lived in the midst of thousands of men The devastating wars which destroyed empires were a thought that existed in the mind of an individual The supreme teachings that changed the course of humanity were the ideas of a man whose genius separated him from his environment A single thought build the Pyramids founded the glory of Islam and caused the burning of the library at Alexandria One thought will come to you at night which will elevate you to glory or lead you to asylum One look from a womans eye makes you the happiest man in the world One word from a mans lips will make you rich or poor That word which Selma uttered that night arrested me between my past and future as a boat which is anchored in the midst of the ocean That word awakened me from the slumber of youth and solitude and set me on the stage where life and death play their parts The scent of flowers mingled with the breeze as we came into the garden and sat silently on a bench near a jasmine tree listening to the breathing of sleeping nature while in the blue sky the eyes of heaven witnessed our drama The moon came out from behind Mount Sannin and shone over the coast hills and mountains and we could see the villages fringing the valley like apparitions which have suddenly been conjured from nothing We could see the beauty of Lebanon under the silver rays of the moon Poets of the West think of Lebanon as a legendary place forgotten since the passing of David and Solomon and the Prophets as the Garden of Eden became lost after the fall of Adam and Eve To those Western poets the word Lebanon is a poetical expression associated with a mountain whose sides are drenched with the incense of the Holy Cedars It reminds them of the temples of copper and marble standing stern and impregnable and of a herd of deer feeding in the valleys That night I saw Lebanon dreamlike with the eyes of a poet Thus the appearance of things changes according to the emotions and thus we see magic and beauty in them while the magic and beauty are really in ourselves As the rays of the moon shone on the face neck and arms of Selma she looked like a statue of ivory sculptured by the fingers of some worshiper of Ishtar goddess of beauty and love As she looked at me she said Why are you silent Why do you not tell me something about your past As I gazed at her my muteness vanished and I opened my lips and said Did you not hear what I said when we came to this orchard The spirit that hears the whispering of flowers and the singing of silence can also hear the shrieking of my soul and the clamor of my heart She covered her face with her hands and said in a trembling voice Yes I heard you I heard a voice coming from the bosom of night and a clamor raging in the heart of the day Forgetting my past my very existence everything but Selma I answered her saying And I heard you too Selma I heard exhilarating music pulsing in the air and causing the whole universe to tremble Upon hearing these words she closed her eyes and her lips I saw a smile of pleasure mingled with sadness She whispered softly Now I know that there is something higher than heaven and deeper than the ocean and stranger than life and death and time I know now what I did not know before At that moment Selma became dearer than a friend and closer than a sister and more beloved than a sweetheart She became a supreme thought a beautiful an overpowering emotion living in my spirit It is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship Love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment it will not be created in years or even generations Then Selma raised her head and gazed at the horizon where Mount Sannin meets the sky and said Yesterday you were like a brother to me with whom I lived and by whom I sat calmly under my fathers care Now I feel the presence of something stranger and sweeter than brotherly affection an unfamiliar commingling of love and fear that fills my heart with sorrow and happiness I responded This emotion which we fear and which shakes us when it passes through our hearts is the law of nature that guides the moon around the earth and the sun around the God She put her hand on my head and wove her fingers thought my hair Her face brightened and tears came out of her eyes like drops of dew on the leaves of a lily and she said Who would believe our story who would believe that in this hour we have surmounted the obstacles of doubt Who would believe that the month of Nisan which brought us together for the first time is the month that halted us in the Holy of Holies of life Her hand was still on my head as she spoke and I would not have preferred a royal crown or a wreath of glory to that beautiful smooth hand whose fingers were twined in my hair Then I answered her People will not believe our story because they do not know what love is the only flower that grows and blossoms without the aid of seasons but was it Nisan that brought us together for the first time and is it this hour that has arrested us in the Holy of Holies of life Is it not the hand of God that brought our souls close together before birth and made us prisoners of each other for all the days and nights Mans life does not commence in the womb and never ends in the grave and this firmament full of moonlight and stars is not deserted by loving souls and intuitive spirits As she drew her hand away from my head I felt a kind of electrical vibration at the roots of my hair mingled with the night breeze Like a devoted worshiper who receives his blessing by kissing the altar in a shrine I took Selmas hand placed my burning lips on it and gave it a long kiss the memory of which melts my heart and awakens by its sweetness all the virtue of my spirit An hour passed every minute of which was a year of love The silence of the night moonlight flowers and trees made us forget all reality except love when suddenly we heard the galloping of horses and rattling of carriage wheels Awakened from our pleasant swoon and plunged from the world of dreams into the world of perplexity and misery we found that the old man had returned from his mission We rose and walked through the orchard to meet him Then the carriage reached the entrance of the garden Farris Effandi dismounted and slowly walked towards us bending forward slightly as if he were carrying a heavy load He approached Selma and placed both of his hands on her shoulders and stared at her Tears coursed down his wrinkled cheeks and his lips trembled with sorrowful smile In a choking voice he said My beloved Selma very soon you will be taken away from the arms of your father to the arms of another man Very soon fate will carry you from this lonely home to the worlds spacious court and this garden will miss the pressure of your footsteps and your father will become a stranger to you All is done may God bless you Hearing these words Selmas face clouded and her eyes froze as if she felt a premonition of death Then she screamed like a bird shot down suffering and trembling and in a choked voice said What do you say What do you mean Where are you sending me Then she looked at him searchingly trying to discover his secret In a moment she said I understand I understand everything The Bishop has demanded me from you and has prepared a cage for this bird with broken wings Is this your will Father His answer was a deep sigh Tenderly he led Selma into the house while I remained standing in the garden waves of perplexity beating upon me like a tempest upon autumn leaves Then I followed them into the living room and to avoid embarrassment shook the old mans hand looked at Selma my beautiful star and left the house As I reached the end of the garden I heard the old man calling me and turned to meet him Apologetically he took my hand and said Forgive me my son I have ruined your evening with the shedding of tears but please come to see me when my house is deserted and I am lonely and desperate Youth my dear son does not combine with senility as morning does not have meet the night but you will come to me and call to my memory the youthful days which I spent with your father and you will tell me the news of life which does not count me as among its sons any longer Will you not visit me when Selma leaves and I am left here in loneliness While he said these sorrowful words and I silently shook his hand I felt the warm tears falling from his eyes upon my hand Trembling with sorrow and filial affection I felt as if my heart were choked with grief When I raised my head and he saw the tears in my eyes he bent toward me and touched my forehead with his lips Goodbye son Goodbye An old mans tear is more potent than that of a young man because it is the residuum of life in his weakening body A young mans tear is like a drop of dew on the leaf of a rose while that of an old man is like a yellow leaf which falls with the wind at the approach of winter As I left the house of Farris Effandi Karamy Selmas voice still rang in my ears her beauty followed me like a wraith and her fathers tears dried slowly on my hand My departure was like Adams exodus from Paradise but the Eve of my heart was not with me to make the whole world an Eden That night in which I had been born again I felt that I saw deaths face for the first time Thus the sun enlivens and kills the fields with its heat Everything that a man does secretly in the darkness of night will be clearly revealed in the daylight Words uttered in privacy will become unexpectedly common conversation Deed which we hide today in the corners of our lodgings will be shouted on every street tomorrow Thus the ghosts of darkness revealed the purpose of Bishop Bulos Galibs meeting with Farris Effandi Karamy and his conversation was repeated all over the neighborhood until it reached my ears The discussion that took place between Bishop Buols Galib and Farris Effandi that night was not over the problems of the poor or the widows and orphans The main purpose for sending after Farris Effandi and bringing him in the Bishops private carriage was the betrothal of Selma to the Bishops nephew Mansour Bey Galib Selma was the only child of the wealthy Farris Effandi and the Bishops choice fell on Selma not on account of her beauty and noble spirit but on account of her fathers money which would guarantee Mansour Bey a good and prosperous fortune and make him an important man The heads of religion in the East are not satisfied with their own munificence but they must strive to make all members of their families superiors and oppressors The glory of a prince goes to his eldest son by inheritance but the exaltation of a religious head is contagious among his brothers and nephews Thus the Christian bishop and the Moslem imam and the Brahman priest become like sea reptiles who clutch their prey with many tentacles and suck their blood with numerous mouths When the Bishop demanded Selmas hand for his nephew the only answer that he received from her father was a deep silence and falling tears for he hated to lose his only child Any mans soul trembles when he is separated from his only daughter whom he has reared to young womanhood The sorrow of parents at the marriage of a daughter is equal to their happiness at the marriage of a son because a son brings to the family a new member while a daughter upon her marriage is lost to them Farris Effandi perforce granted the Bishops request obeying his will unwillingly because Farris Effandi knew the Bishops nephew very well knew that he was dangerous full of hate wickedness and corruption In Lebanon no Christian could oppose his bishop and remain in good standing No man could disobey his religious head and keep his reputation The eye could not resist a spear without being pierced and the hand could not grasp a sword without being cut off Suppose that Farris Effandi had resisted the Bishop and refused his wish then Selmas reputation would have been ruined and her name would have been blemished by the dirt of lips and tongues In the opinion of the fox high bunches of grapes that cant be reached are sour Thus destiny seized Selma and led her like a humiliated slave in the procession of miserable oriental woman and thus fell that noble spirit into the trap after having flown freely on the white wings of love in a sky full of moonlight scented with the odor of flowers In some countries the parents wealth is a source of misery for the children The wide strong box which the father and mother together have used for the safety of their wealth becomes a narrow dark prison for the souls of their heirs The Almighty Dinar which the people worship becomes a demon which punished the spirit and deadens the heart Selma Karamy was one of those who were the victims of their parents wealth and bridegrooms cupidity Had it not been for her fathers wealth Selma would still be living happily A week had passed The love of Selma was my sole entertainer singing songs of happiness for me at night and waking me at dawn to reveal the meaning of life and the secrets of nature It is a heavenly love that is free from jealousy rich and never harmful to the spirit It is deep affinity that bathes the soul in contentment a deep hunger for affection which when satisfied fills the soul with bounty a tenderness that creates hope without agitating the soul changing earth to paradise and life to a sweet and a beautiful dream In the morning when I walked in the fields I saw the token of Eternity in the awakening of nature and when I sat by the seashore I heard the waves singing the song of Eternity And when I walked in the streets I saw the beauty of life and the splendor of humanity in the appearance of passersby and movements of workers Those days passed like ghosts and disappeared like clouds and soon nothing was left for me but sorrowful memories The eye with which I used to look at the beauty of spring and the awakening of nature could see nothing but the fury of the tempest and the misery of winter The ears with which I formerly heard with delight the song of the waves could hear only the howling of the wind and the wrath of the sea against the precipice The soul which had observed happily the tireless vigor of mankind and the glory of the universe was tortured by the knowledge of disappointment and failure Nothing was more beautiful than those days of love and nothing was more bitter than those horrible nights of sorrow When I could no longer resist the impulse i went on the weekend once more to Selmas home the shrine which Beauty had erected and which Love had blessed in which the spirit could worship and the heart kneel humbly and pray When I entered the garden I felt a power pulling me away from this world and placing me in a sphere supernaturally free from struggle and hardship Like a mystic who receives a revelation of Heaven I saw myself amid the trees and flowers and as I approached the entrance of the house I beheld Selma sitting on the bench in the shadow of a jasmine tree where we both had sat the week before on that night which Providence had chosen for the beginning of my happiness and sorrow She neither moved nor spoke as I approached her She seemed to have known intuitively that I was coming and when I sat by her she gazed at me for a moment and sighed deeply then turned her head and looked at the sky And after a moment full of magic silence she turned back toward me and tremblingly took my hand and said in a faint voice Look at me my friend study my face and I read in it that which you want to know and which I can not recite Look at me my beloved look at me my brother I gazed at her intently and saw that those eyes which a few days ago were smiling like lips and moving like the wings of a nightingale eyes were already sunken and glazed with sorrow and pain Her face that had resembled the unfolding sunkissed leaves of a lily had faded and become colorless Her sweet lips were like two withering roses that autumn has left on their stems Her neck that had been a column of ivory was bent forward as if it no longer could support the burden of grief in her head All these changes I saw in Selmas face but to me they were like a passing cloud that covered the face of the moon and makes it more beautiful A look which reveals inward stress adds more beauty to the face no matter how much tragedy and pain it bespeaks but the face which in silence does not announce hidden mysteries is not beautiful regardless of the symmetry of its features The cup does not entice our lips unless the wines color is seen through the transparent crystal Selma on that evening was like a cup full of heavenly wine concocted of the bitterness and sweetness of life Unaware she symbolized the oriental woman who never leaves her parents home until she puts upon her neck the heavy yoke of her husband who never leaves her loving mothers arms until she must live as a slave enduring the harshness of her husbands mother I continued to look at Selma and listen to her depressed spirit and suffer with her until I felt that time has ceased and the universe had faded from existence I could see only her two large eyes staring fixedly at me and could feel only her cold trembling hand holding mine I woke from my swoon hearing Selma saying quietly Come by beloved let us discuss the horrible future before it comes My father has just left the house to see the man who is going to be my companion until death My father whom God chose for the purpose of my existence will meet the man whom the world has selected to be my master for the rest of my life In the heart of this city the old man who accompanied me during my youth will meet the young man who will be my companion for the coming years Tonight the two families will set the marriage date What a strange and impressive hour Last week at this time under this jasmine tree Love embraced my soul for the first time okay While Destiny was writing the first word of my lifes story at the Bishops mansion Now while my father and my suitor are planning the day of marriage I see your spirit quivering around me as a thirsty bird flickers above a spring of water guarded by a hungry serpent Oh how great this night is And how deep is its mystery Hearing these words I felt that dark ghost of complete despondency was seizing our love to choke it in its infancy and I answered her That bird will remain flickering over that spring until thirst destroys him or falls into the grasp of a serpent and becomes its prey She responded No my beloved this nightingale should remain alive and sing until dark comes until spring passes until the end of the world and keep on singing eternally His voice should not be silenced because he brings life to my heart his wings should not be broken because their motion removes the cloud from my heart Then I whispered Selma my beloved thirst will exhaust him and fear will kill him She replied immediately with trembling lips The thirst of soul is sweeter than the wine of material things and the fear of spirit is dearer than the security of the body But listen my beloved listen carefully I am standing today at the door of a new life which I know nothing about I am like a blind man who feels his way so that he will not fall My fathers wealth has placed me in the slave market and this man has bought me I neither know nor love him but I shall learn to love him and I shall obey him serve him and make him happy I shall give him all that a weak woman can give a strong man But you my beloved are still in the prime of life You can walk freely upon lifes spacious path carpeted with flowers You are free to traverse the world making of your heart a torch to light your way You can think talk and act freely you can write your name on the face of life because you are a man you can live as a master because your fathers wealth will not place you in the slave market to be bought and sold you can marry the woman of your choice and before she lives in your home you can let her reside in your heart and can exchange confidences without hindrances Silence prevailed for a moment and Selma continued But is it now that Life will tear us apart so that you may attain the glory of a man and I the duty of a woman Is it for this that the valley swallows the song of the nightingale in its depths and the wind scatters the petals of the rose and the feet tread upon the wind cup Were all those nights we spent in the moonlight by the jasmine tree where our souls united in vain Did we fly swiftly toward the stars until our wings tired and are we descending now into the abyss Or was Love asleep when he came to us and did he when he woke become angry and decide to punish us Or did our spirits turn the nights breeze into a wind that tore us to pieces and blew us like dust to the depth of the valley We disobeyed no commandment nor did we taste of forbidden fruit so what is making us leave this paradise We never conspired or practiced mutiny then why are we descending to hell No no the moments which united us are greater than centuries and the light that illuminated our spirits is stronger than the dark and if the tempest separates us on this rough ocean the waves will unite us on the calm shore and if this life kills us death will unite us A womans heart will change with time or season even if it dies eternally it will never perish A womans heart is like a field turned into a battleground after the trees are uprooted and the grass is burned and the rocks are reddened with blood and the earth is planted with bones and skulls it is calm and silent as if nothing has happened for the spring and autumn come at their intervals and resume their work And now my beloved what shall we do How shall we part and when shall we meet Shall we consider love a strange visitor who came in the evening and left us in the morning Or shall we suppose this affection a dream that came in our sleep and departed when we awoke Shall we consider this week an hour of intoxication to be replaced by soberness Raise your head and let me look at you my beloved open your lips and let me hear your voice Speak to me Will you remember me after this tempest has sunk the ship of our love Will you hear the whispering of my wings in the silence of the night Will you hear my spirit fluttering over you Will you listen to my sighs Will you see my shadow approach with the shadows of dusk and disappear with the flush of dawn Tell me my beloved what will you be after having been magic ray to my eyes sweet song to my ears and wings to my soul What will you be Hearing these words my heart melted and I answered her I will be as you want me to be my beloved Then she said I want you to love me as a poet loves his sorrowful thoughts I want you to remember me as a traveler remembers a calm pool in which his image was reflected as he drank its water I want you to remember me as a mother remember her child that died before it saw the light and I want you to remember me as a merciful king remembers a prisoner who died before his pardon reached him I want you to be my companion and I want you to visit my father and console him in his solitude because I shall be leaving him soon and shall be a stranger to him I answered her saying I will do all you have said and will make my soul an envelope for your soul and my heart a residence for your beauty and my breast a grave for your sorrows I shall love you Selma as the prairies love the spring and I shall live in you in the life of a flower under the suns rays I shall sing your name as the valley sings the echo of the bells of the village churches I shall listen to the language of your soul as the shore listens to the story of the waves I shall remember you as a stranger remembers his beloved country and as a hungry man remembers a banquet and as a dethroned king remembers the days of his glory and as a prisoner remembers the hours of ease and freedom I shall remember you as a sower remembers the bundles of wheat on his threshing flour and as a shepherd remembers the green prairies the sweet brooks Selma listened to my words with palpitating heart and said Tomorrow the truth will become ghostly and the awakening will be like a dream Will a lover be satisfied embracing a ghost or will a thirsty man quench his thirst from the spring or a dream I answered her Tomorrow destiny will put you in the midst of a peaceful family but it will send me into the world of struggle and warfare You will be in the home of a person whom chance has made most fortunate through your beauty and virtue while I shall be living a life of suffering and fear You will enter the gate of life while I shall enter the gate of death You will be received hospitably while I shall exist in solitude but I shall erect a statue of love and worship it in the valley of death Love will be my sole comforter and I shall drink love like wine and wear it like garment At dawn Love will wake me from slumber and take me to the distant field and at noon will lead me to the shadows of trees where I will find shelter with the birds from the heat of the sun In the evening it will cause me to pause before sunset to hear natures farewell song to the light of day and will show me ghostly clouds sailing in the sky At night Love will embrace me and I shall sleep dreaming of the heavenly world where the spirits of lovers and poets abide In the Spring I shall walk side by side with love among violets and jasmines and drink the remaining drops of winter in the lily cups In Summer we shall make the bundles of hay our pillows and the grass our bed and the blue sky will cover us as we gaze at the stars and the moon In Autumn Love and I will go to the vineyard and sit by the wine press and watch the grapevines being denuded of their golden ornaments and the migrating flocks of birds will wing over us In Winter we shall sit by the fireside reciting stories of long ago and chronicles of far countries During my youth Love will be my teacher in middle age my help and in old age my delight Love my beloved Selma will stay with me to the end of my life and after death the hand of God will unite us again All these words came from the depths of my heart like flames of fire which leap raging from the hearth and then disappear in the ashes Selma was weeping as if her eyes were lips answering me with tears Those whom love has not given wings cannot fly the cloud of appearances to see the magic world in which Selmas spirit and mine existed together in that sorrowfully happy hour Those whom Love has not chosen as followers do not hear when Love calls This story is not for them Even if they should comprehend these pages they would not be able to grasp the shadowy meanings which are not clothed in words and do not reside on paper but what human being is he who has never sipped the wine from the cup of love and what spirit is it that has never stood reverently before that lighted altar in the temple whose pavement is the hearts of men and women and whose ceiling is the secret canopy of dreams What flower is that on whose leaves the dawn has never poured a drop of dew what streamlet is that which lost its course without going to the sea Selma raised her face toward the sky and gazed at the heavenly stars which studded the firmament She stretched out her hands her eyes widened and her lips trembled On her pale face I could see the signs of sorrow oppression hopelessness and pain Then she cried Oh Lord what has a woman done that hath offended Thee What sin has she committed to deserve such a punishment For what crime has she been awarded everlasting castigation Oh Lord Thou art strong and I am weak Why hast Thou made me suffer pain Thou art great and almighty while I am nothing but a tiny creature crawling before Thy throne Why hast Thou crushed me with Thy foot Thou art a raging tempest and I am like dust why my Lord hast Thou flung me upon the cold earth Thou art powerful and I am helpless why art Thou fighting me Thou art considerate and I am prudent why art Thou destroying me Thou hast created woman with love and why with love dost Thou ruin her With Thy right hand dost Thou lift her and with Thy left hand dost Thou strike her into the abyss and she knows not why In her mouth Thou blowest the breath of Life and in her heart Thou sowest the seeds of death Thou dost show her the path of happiness but Thou leadest her in the road of misery in her mouth Thou dost place a song of happiness but then Thou dost close her lips with sorrow and dost fetter her tongue with agony With Thy mysterious fingers dost Thou dress her wounds and with Thine hands Thou drawest the dread of pain round her pleasures In her bed Thou hidest pleasure and peace but beside it Thou dost erect obstacles and fear Thou dost excite her affection through Thy will and from her affection does shame emanate By Thy will Thou showest her the beauty of creation but her love for beauty becomes a terrible famine Thou dost make her drink life in the cup of death and death in the cup of life Thou purifiest her with tears and in tears her life streams away Oh Lord Thou hast opened my eyes with love and with love Thou hast blinded me Thou hast kissed me with Thy lips and struck me with Thy strong hand Thou has planted in my heart a white rose but around the rose a barrier of thorns Thou hast tied my present with the spirit of a young man whom I love but my life with the body of an unknown man So help me my Lord to be strong in this deadly struggle and assist me to be truthful and virtuous until death Thy will be done Oh Lord God Silence continued Selma looked down pale and frail her arms dropped and her head bowed and it seemed to me as if a tempest had broken a branch from a tree and cast it down to dry and perish I took her cold hand and kissed it but when I attempted to console her it was I who needed consolation more than she did I kept silent thinking of our plight and listening to my heartbeats Neither of us said more Extreme torture is mute and so we sat silent petrified like columns of marble buried under the sand of an earthquake Neither wished to listen to the other because our heartthreads had become weak and even breathing would have broken them It was midnight and we could see the crescent moon rising from behind Mount Sannin and it looked in the midst of the stars like the face of a corpse in a coffin surrounded by the dim lights of candles And Lebanon looked like an old man whose back was bent with age and whose eyes were a haven for insomnia watching the dark and waiting for dawn like asking sitting on the ashes of his throne in the debris of his palace The mountains trees and rivers change their appearance with the vicissitudes of times and seasons as a man changes with his experiences and emotions The lofty poplar that resembles a bride in the daytime will look like a column of smoke in the evening the huge rock that stands impregnable at noon will appear to be a miserable pauper at night with earth for his bed and the sky for his cover and the rivulet that we see glittering in the morning and hear singing the hymn of Eternity will in the evening turn to a stream of tears wailing like a mother bereft of her child and Lebanon that had looked dignified a week before when the moon was full and our spirits were happy looked sorrowful and lonesome that night He stood up and bade each other farewell but love and despair stood between us like two ghosts one stretching his wings with his fingers over our throats one weeping and the other laughing hideously As I took Selmas hand and put it to my lips she came close to me and placed a kiss on my forehead then dropped on the wooden bench She shut her eyes and whispered softly Oh Lord God have mercy on me and mend my broken wings As I left Selma in the garden I felt as if my senses were covered with a thick veil like a lake whose surface is concealed by fog The beauty of trees the moonlight the deep silence everything about me looked ugly and horrible The true light that had showed me the beauty and wonder of the universe was converted to a great flame of fire that seared my heart and the Eternal music I used to hear became a clamor more frightening than the roar of a lion I reached my room and like a wounded bird shot down by a hunter I fell on my bed repeating the words of Selma Oh Lord God have mercy on me and mend my broken wings Marriage in these days is a mockery whose management is in the hands of young men and parents In most countries the young men win while the parents lose The woman is looked upon as a commodity purchased and delivered from one house to another In time her beauty fades and she becomes like an old piece of furniture left in a dark corner Modern civilization has made woman a little wiser but it has increased her suffering because of mans covetousness The woman of yesterday was a happy wife but the woman of today is a miserable mistress In the past she walked blindly in the light but now she walks openeyed in the dark She was beautiful in her ignorance virtuous in her simplicity and strong in her weakness Today she has become ugly in her ingenuity superficial and heartless in her knowledge Will the day ever come when beauty and knowledge ingenuity and virtue and weakness of body and strength of spirit will be united in a woman I am one of those who believe that spiritual progress is a rule of human life but the approach to perfection is slow and painful If a woman elevates herself in one respect and is retarded in another it is because the rough trail that leads to the mountain peak is not free of ambushes of thieves and lairs of wolves This strange generation exists between sleeping and waking It holds in its hands the soil of the past and the seeds of the future However we find in every city a woman who symbolizes the future In the city of Beirut Selma Karamy was the symbol of the future Oriental woman but like many who lie ahead of their time she became the victim of the present and like a flower snatched from its stem and carried away by the current of a river she walked in the miserable procession of the defeated Mansour Bey Galib and Selma were married and lived together in a beautiful house at Ras Beyrouth where all the wealthy dignitaries resided Farris Effandi Karamy was left in his solitary home in the midst of his garden and orchards like a lonely shepherd amid his flock The days and merry nights of the wedding passed but the honeymoon left memories of times of bitter sorrow as wars leave skulls and dead bones on the battlefield The dignity of an Oriental wedding inspires the hearts of young men and women but its termination may drop them like millstones to the bottom of the sea Their exhilaration is like footprints on sand which remain only till they are washed away by the waves Spring departed and so did summer and autumn but my love for Selma increased day by day until it became a kind of mute worship the feeling that an orphan has toward the soul of his mother in Heaven My yearning was converted to blind sorrow that could see nothing but itself and the passion that drew tears from my eyes was replaced by perplexity that sucked the blood from my heart and my sighs of affection became a constant prayer for the happiness of Selma and her husband and peace for her father My hopes and prayers were in vain because Selmas misery was an internal malady that nothing but death could cure Mansour Bey was a man to whom all the luxuries of life came easily but in spite of that he was dissatisfied and rapacious After marrying Selma he neglected her father in his loneliness and prayed for his death so that he could inherit what was left of the old mans wealth Mansour Beys character was similar to his uncles the only difference between the two was that the Bishop got everything he wanted secretly under the protection of his ecclesiastical robe and the golden cross which he wore on his chest while his nephew did everything publicly The Bishop went to church in the morning and spent the rest of the day pilfering from the widows orphans and simple minded people But Mansour Bey spent his days in pursuit of sexual satisfaction On Sunday Bishop Bulos Galib preached his Gospel but during weekdays he never practiced what he preached occupying himself with political intrigues of the locality And by means of his uncles prestige and influence Mansour Bey made it his business to secure political plums for those who could offer a sufficient bribe Bishop Bulos was a thief who hid himself under the cover of night while his nephew Mansour Bey was a swindler who walked proudly in daylight However the people of Oriental nations place trust in such as theywolves and butchers who ruin their country through covetousness and crush their neighbors with an iron hand Why do I occupy these pages with words about the betrayers of poor nations instead of reserving all the space for the story of a miserable woman with a broken heart Why do I shed tears for oppressed peoples rather than keep all my tears for the memory of a weak woman whose life was snatched by the teeth of death But my dear readers dont you think that such a woman is like a nation that is oppressed by priests and rulers Dont you believe that thwarted love which leads a woman to the grave is like the despair which pervades the people of the earth A woman is to a nation as light is to a lamp Will not the light be dim if the oil in the lamp is low Autumn passed and the wind blew the yellow leaves form the trees making way for winter which came howling and crying I was still in the City of Beirut without a companion save my dreams which would lift my spirit to the sky and then bury it deep in the bosom of the earth The sorrowful spirit finds relaxation in solitude It abhors people as a wounded deer deserts the herd and lives in a cave until it is healed or dead One day I heard Farris Effandi was ill I left my solitary abode and walked to his home taking a new route a lonely path between olive trees avoiding the main road with its rattling carriage wheels Arriving at the old mans house I entered and found Farris Effandi lying on his bed weak and pale His eyes were sunken and looked like two deep dark valleys haunted by the ghosts of pain The smile which had always enlivened his face was choked with pain and agony and the bones of his gentle hands looked like naked branches trembling before the tempest As I approached him and inquired as to his health he turned his pale face toward me and on his trembling lips appeared a smile and he said in a weak voice Go go my son to the other room and comfort Selma and bring her to sit by the side of my bed I entered the adjacent room and found Selma lying on a divan covering her head with her arms and burying her face in a pillow so that her father would not hear her weeping Approaching slowly I pronounced her name in a voice that seemed more like sighing than whispering She moved fearfully as if she had been interrupted in a terrible dream and sat up looking at me with glazed eyes doubting whether I was a ghost or a living being After a deep silence which took us back on the wings of memory to that hour when we were intoxicated with wine of love Selma wiped away her tears and said See how time has changed us See how time has changed the course of our lives and left us in these ruins In this place spring united us in a bond of love and in this place has brought us together before the throne of death How beautiful was spring and how terrible is this winter Speaking thus she covered her face again with her hands as if she were shielding her eyes from the specter of the past standing before her I put my hand on her head and said Come Selma come and let us be as strong towers before the tempest Let us stand like brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons If we are killed we shall die as martyrs and if we win we shall live as heroes Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility The butterfly that hovers around the lamp until it dies is more admirable than the mole that lives in a dark tunnel Come Selma let us walk this rough path firmly with our eyes toward the sun so that we may not see the skulls and serpents among the rocks and thorns If fear should stop us in middle of the road we would hear only ridicule from the voices of the night but if we reach the mountain peak bravely we shall join the heavenly spirits in songs of triumph and joy Cheer up Selma wipe away your tears and remove the sorrow from your face Rise and let us sit by the bed of your father because his life depends on your life and your smile is his only cure Kindly and affectionately she looked at me and said Are you asking me to have patience while you are in need of it yourself Will a hungry man give his bread to another hungry man Or will sick man give medicine to another which he himself needs badly She rose her head bent slightly forward and we walked to the old mans room and sat by the side of his bed Selma forced a smile and pretended to be patient and her father tried to make her believe that he was feeling better and getting stronger but both father and daughter were aware of each others sorrow and heard the unvoiced sighs They were like two equal forces wearing each other away silently The fathers heart was melting because of his daughters plight They were two pure souls one departing and the other agonized with grief embracing in love and death and I was between the two with my own troubled heart We were three people gathered and crushed by the hands of destiny an old man like a dwelling ruined by flood a young woman whose symbol was a lily beheaded by the sharp edge of a sickle and a young man who was a weak sapling bent by a snowfall and all of us were toys in the hands of fate Farris Effandi moved slowly and stretched his weak hand toward Selma and in a loving and tender voice said Hold my hand my beloved Selma held his hand then he said I have lived long enough and I have enjoyed the fruits of lifes seasons I have experienced all its phases with equanimity I lost your mother when you were three years of age and she left you as a precious treasure in my lap I watched you grow and your face reproduced your mothers features as stars reflected in a calm pool of water Your character intelligence and beauty are your mothers even your manner of speaking and gestures You have been my only consolation in this life because you were the image of your mother in every deed and word Now I grow old and my only resting place is between the soft wings of death Be comforted my beloved daughter because I have lived long enough to see you as a woman Be happy because I shall live in you after my death My departure today would be no different from my going tomorrow or the day after for our days are perishing like the leaves of autumn The hour of my days are perishing like the leaves of autumn The hour of my death approaches rapidly and my soul is desirous of being united with your mothers As he uttered these words sweetly and lovingly his face was radiant Then he put his hand under his pillow and pulled out a small picture in a gold frame With his eyes on the little photograph he said Come Selma come and see your mother in this picture Selma wiped away her tears and after gazing long at the picture she kissed it repeatedly and cried Oh my beloved mother Oh mother Then she placed her trembling lips on the picture as if she wished to pour her soul into that image The most beautiful word on the lips of mankind is the word Mother and the most beautiful call is the call of My mother it is a word full of hope and love a sweet and kind word coming from the depths of the heart The mother is every thing she is our consolation in sorrow our hope in misery and our strength in weakness She is the source of love mercy sympathy and forgiveness He who loses his mother loses a pure soul who blesses and guards him constantly Every thing in nature bespeaks the mother The sun is the mother of earth and gives it its nourishment of hear it never leaves the universe at night until it has put the earth to sleep to the song of the sea and the hymn of birds and brooks And this earth is the mother of trees and flowers It produces them nurses them and weans them The trees and flowers become kind mothers of their great fruits and seeds And the mother the prototype of all existence is the eternal spirit full of beauty and love Selma Karamy never knew her mother because she had died when Selma was an infant but Selma wept when she saw the picture and cried Oh mother The word mother is hidden in our hearts and it comes upon our lips in hours of sorrow and happiness as the perfume comes from the heart of the rose and mingles with clear and cloudy air Selma stared at her mothers picture kissing it repeatedly until she collapsed by her fathers bed The old man placed both hands on her head and said I have shown you my dear child a picture of your mother on paper Now listen to me and I shall let you hear her words She lifted her head like a little bird in the nest that hears its mothers wing and looked at him attentively Farris Effandi opened his mouth and said Your mother was nursing you when she lost her father she cried and wept at his going but she was wise and patient She sat by me in this room as soon as the funeral was over and held my hand and said Farris my father is dead now and you are my only consolation in this world The hearts affections are divided like the branches of the cedar tree if the tree loses one strong branch it will suffer but it does not die It will pour all its vitality into the next branch so that it will grow and fill the empty place This is what your mother told me when her father died and you should say the same thing when death takes my body to its resting place and my soul to Gods care Selma answered him with falling tears and broken heart When Mother lost her father you took his place but who is going to take yours when you are gone She was left in the care of a loving and truthful husband she found consolation in her little daughter and who will be my consolation when you pass away You have been my father and mother and the companion of my youth Saying these words she turned and looked at me and holding the side of my garment said This is the only friend I shall have after you are gone but how can he console me when he is suffering also How can a broken heart find consolation in a disappointed soul A sorrowful woman cannot be comforted by her neighbors sorrow nor can a bird fly with broken wings He is the friend of my soul but I have already placed a heavy burden of sorrow upon him and dimmed his eyes with my tears till he can see nothing but darkness He is a brother whom I dearly love but he is like all brothers who share my sorrow and help me shed tears which increase my bitterness and burn my heart Selmas words stabbed my heart and I felt that I could bear no more The old man listened to her with depressed spirit The old man listened to her with depressed spirit trembling like the light of a lamp before the wind Then he stretched out his hand and said Let me go peacefully my child I have broken the bars of this cage let me fly and do not stop me for your mother is calling me The sky is clear and the sea is calm and the boat is ready to sail do not delay its voyage Let my body rest with those who are resting let my dream end and my soul awaken with the dawn let your soul embrace mine and give me the kiss of hope let no drops of sorrow or bitterness fall upon my body lest the flowers and grass refuse their nourishment Do not shed tears of misery upon my hand for they may grow thorns upon my grave Do not draw lines of agony upon my forehead for the wind may pass and read them and refuse to carry the dust of my bones to the green prairies I love you my child while I lived and I shall love you when I am dead and my soul shall always watch over you and protect you Then Farris Effandi looked at me with his eyes half closed and said My son be a real brother to Selma as your father was to me Be her help and friend in need and do not let her mourn because mourning for the dead is a mistake Repeat to her pleasant tales and sing for her the songs of life so that she may forget her sorrows Remember me to your father ask him to tell you the stories of your youth and tell him that I loved him in the person of his son in the last hour of my life Silence prevailed and I could see the pallor of death on the old mans face Then he rolled his eyes and looked at us and whispered Dont call the physician for he might extend my sentence in this prison by his medicine The days of slavery are gone and my soul seeks the freedom of the skies And do not call the priest to my bedside because his incantations would not save me if I were a sinner nor would it rush me to Heaven if I were innocent The will of humanity cannot change the will of God as an astrologer cannot change the course of the stars But after my death let the doctors and priest do what they please for my ship will continue sailing until it reaches its destination At midnight Farris Effandi opened his tired eyes for the last time and focused them on Selma who was kneeling by his bedside He tried to speak but could not for death had already choked his voice but he finally managed to say The night has passed Oh SelmaOhOh Selma Then he bent his head his face turned white and I could see a smile on his lips as he breathed his last Selma felt her fathers hand It was cold Then she raised her head and looked at his face It was covered with the veil of death Selma was so choked that she could not shed tears nor sigh nor even move For a moment she stared at him with fixed eyes like those of a statue then she bent down until her forehead touched the floor and said Oh Lord have mercy and mend our broken wings Farris Effandi Karamy died his soul was embraced by Eternity and his body was returned to the earth Mansour Bey Galib got possession of his wealth and Selma became a prisoner of lifea life of grief and misery I was lost in sorrow and reverie Days and nights preyed upon me as the eagle ravages its victim Many a time I tried to forget my misfortune by occupying myself with books and scriptures of past generation but it was like extinguishing fire with oil for I could see nothing in the procession of the past but tragedy and could hear nothing but weeping and wailing The Book of Job was more fascinating to me than the Psalms and I preferred the Elegies of Jeremiah to the Song of Solomon Hamlet was closer to my heart than all other dramas of western writers Thus despair weakens our sight and closes our ears We can see nothing but specters of doom and can hear only the beating of our agitated hearts In the midst of the gardens and hills which connect the city of Beirut with Lebanon there is a small temple very ancient dug out of white rock surrounded by olive almond and willow trees Although this temple is a half mile from the main highway at the time of my story very few people interested in relics and ancient ruins had visited it It was one of many interesting places hidden and forgotten in Lebanon Due to its seclusion it had become a haven for worshippers and a shrine for lonely lovers As one enters this temple he sees on the wall at the east side an old Phoenician picture carved in the rock depicting Ishtar goddess of love and beauty sitting on her throne surrounded by seven nude virgins standing in different posses The first one carries a torch the second a guitar the third a censer the fourth a jug of wine the fifth a branch of roses the sixth a wreath of laurel the seventh a bow and arrow and all of them look at Ishtar reverently On the second wall there is another picture more modern than the first one symbolizing Christ nailed to the cross and at His side stand His sorrowful mother and Mary Magdalene and two other women weeping This Byzantine picture shows that it was carved in the fifteenth or sixteenth century On the west side wall there are two round transits through which the suns rays enter the temple and strike the pictures and make them look as if they were painted with gold water color In the middle of the temple there is a square marble with old paintings on its sides some of which can hardly be seen under the petrified lumps of blood which show that the ancient people offered sacrifices on this rock and poured perfume wine and oil upon it There is nothing else in that little temple except deep silence revealing to the living the secrets of the goddess and speaking worldlessly of past generations and the evolution of religions Such a sight carries the poet to a world far away from the one in which he dwells and convinces the philosopher that men were born religious they felt a need for that which they could not see and drew symbols the meaning of which divulged their hidden secrets and their desires in life and death In that unknown temple I met Selma once every month and spent the hours with her looking at those strange pictures thinking of the crucified Christ and pondering upon the young Phoenician men and women who lived loved and worshipped beauty in the person of Ishtar by burning incense before her statue and pouring perfume on her shrine people for whom nothing is left to speak except the name repeated by the march of time before the face of Eternity It is hard to write down in words the memories of those hours when I met Selma those heavenly hours filled with pain happiness sorrow hope and misery We met secretly in the old temple remembering the old days discussing our present fearing our future and gradually bringing out the hidden secrets in the depths of our hearts and complaining to each other of our misery and suffering trying to console ourselves with imaginary hopes and sorrowful dreams Every now and then we would become calm and wipe our tears and start smiling forgetting everything except Love we embraced each other until our hearts melted then Selma would print a pure kiss on my forehead and fill my heart with ecstasy I would return the kiss as she bent her ivory neck while her cheeks became gently red like the first ray of dawn on the forehead of hills We silently looked at the distant horizon where the clouds were colored with the orange ray of sunset Our conversation was not limited to love every now and then we drifted on to current topics and exchanged ideas During the course of conversation Selma spoke of womans place in society the imprint that the past generation had left on her character the relationship between husband and wife and the spiritual diseases and corruption which threatened married life I remember her saying The poets and writers are trying to understand the reality of woman but up to this day they have not understood the hidden secrets of her heart because they look upon her from behind the sexual veil and see nothing but externals they look upon her through the magnifying glass of hatefulness and find nothing except weakness and submission On another occasion she said pointing to the carved pictures on the walls of the temple In the heart of this rock there are two symbols depicting the essence of a womans desires and revealing the hidden secrets of her soul moving between love and sorrow between affection and sacrifice between Ishtar sitting on the throne and Mary standing by the cross The man buys glory and reputation but the woman pays the price No one knew about our secret meetings except God and the flock of birds which flew over the temple Selma used to come in her carriage to a place named Pasha park and from there she walked to the temple where she found me anxiously waiting for her We feared not the observers eyes neither did our consciences bother us the spirit which is purified by fire and washed by tears is higher than what the people call shame and disgrace it is free from the laws of slavery and old customs against the affections of the human heart That spirit can proudly stand unashamed before the throne of God Human society has yielded for seventy centuries to corrupted laws until it cannot understand the meaning of the superior and eternal laws A mans eyes have become accustomed to the dim light of candles and cannot see the sunlight Spiritual disease is inherited from one generation to another until it has become a part of people who look upon it not as a disease but as a natural gift showered by God upon Adam If those people found someone free from the germs of this disease they would think of him with shame and disgrace Those who think evil of Selma Karamy because she left her husbands home and met me in the temple are the diseased and weakminded kind who look upon the healthy and sound as rebels They are like insects crawling in the dark for fear of being stepped upon by the passerby The oppressed prisoner who can break away from his jail and does not do so is a coward Selma an innocent and oppressed prisoner was unable to free herself from slavery Was she to blame because she looked through the jail window upon the green fields and spacious sky Will the people count her as being untruthful to her husband because she came from his home to sit by me between Christ and Ishtar Let the people say what they please Selma had passed the marshes which submerge other spirits and had landed in a world that could not be reached by the howling of wolves and rattling of snakes People may say what they want about me for the spirit who has seen the specter of death cannot be scared by the faces of thieves the soldier who has seen the swords glittering over his head and streams of blood under his feet does not care about rocks thrown at him by the children on the streets One day in the late part of June as the people left the city for the mountain to avoid the heat of summer I went as usual to the temple to meet Selma carrying with me a little book of Andalusian poems As I reached the temple I sat there waiting for Selma glancing at intervals at the pages of my book reciting those verses which filled my heart with ecstasy and brought to my soul the memory of the kings poets and knights who bade farewell to Granada and left with tears in their eyes and sorrow in their hearts their palaces institutions and hopes behind In an hour I saw Selma walking in the midst of the gardens and I approaching the temple leaning on her parasol as if she were carrying all the worries of the world upon her shoulders As she entered the temple and sat by me I noticed some sort of change in her eyes and I was anxious to inquire about it Selma felt what was going on in my mind and she put her hand on my head and said Come close to me come my beloved come and let me quench my thirst for the hour of separation has come I asked her Did your husband find out about our meeting her She responded My husband does not care about me neither does he know how I spend my time for he is busy with those poor girls whom poverty has driven into the houses of ill fame those girls who sell their bodies for bread kneaded with blood and tears I inquired What prevents you from coming to this temple and sitting by me reverently before God Is your soul requesting our separation She answered with tears in her eyes No my beloved my spirit did not ask for separation for you are a part of me My eyes never get tired of looking at you for you are their light but if destiny ruled that I should walk the rough path of life loaded with shackles would I be satisfied if your fate should be like mine Then she added I cannot say everything because the tongue is mute with pain and cannot talk the lips are sealed with misery and cannot move all I can say to you is that I am afraid you may fall in the same trap I fell in When I asked What do you mean Selma and of whom are you afraid She covered her face with her hands and said The Bishop has already found out that once a month I have been leaving the grave which he buried me in I inquired Did the Bishop find out about our meetings here She answered If he did you would not see me here sitting by you but he is getting suspicious and he informed all his servants and guards to watch me closely I am feeling that the house I live in and the path I walk on are all eyes watching me and fingers pointing at me and ears listening to the whisper of my thoughts She was silent for a while and then she added with tears pouring down her cheeks I am not afraid of the Bishop for wetness does not scare the drowned but I am afraid you might fall into the trap and become his prey you are still young and free as the sunlight I am not frightened of fate which has shot all its arrows in my breast but I am afraid the serpent might bite your feet and detain you from climbing the mountain peak where the future awaits you with its pleasure and glory I said He who has not been bitten by the serpents of light and snapped at by the wolves of darkness will always be deceived by the days and nights But listen Selma listen carefully is separation the only means of avoiding peoples evils and meanness Has the path of love and freedom been closed and is nothing left except submission to the will of the slaves of death She responded Nothing is left save separation and bidding each other farewell With rebellious spirit I took her hand and said excitedly We have yielded to the peoples will for a long time since the time we met until this hour we have been led by the blind and have worshipped with them before their idols Since the time I met you we have been in the hands of the Bishop like two balls which he has thrown around as he pleased Are we going to submit to his will until death takes us away Did God give us the breath of life to place it under deaths feet Did He give us liberty to make it a shadow of slavery He who extinguishes his spirits fire with his own hands is an infidel in the eyes of Heaven for Heaven set the fire that burns in our spirits He who does not rebel against oppression is doing himself injustice I love you Selma and you love me too and Love is a precious treasure it is Gods gift to sensitive and great spirits Shall we throw this treasure away and let the pigs scatter it and trample on it This world is full of wonder and beauty Why are we living in this narrow tunnel which the Bishop and his assistants have dug out for us Life is full of happiness and freedom why dont we take this heavy yoke off our shoulders and break the chains tied to our feet and walk freely toward peace Get up and let us leave this small temple for Gods great temple Let us leave this country and all its slavery and ignorance for another country far away and unreached by the hands of the thieves Let us go to the coast under the cover of night and catch a boat that will take us across the oceans where we can find a new life full of happiness and understanding Do not hesitate Selma for these minutes are more precious to us than the crowns of kings and more sublime than the thrones of angels Let us follow the column of light that leads us from this arid desert into the green fields where flowers and aromatic plants grow She shook her head and gazed at something invisible on the ceiling of the temple a sorrowful smile appeared on her lips then she said No no my beloved Heaven placed in my hand a cup full of vinegar and gall I forced myself to drink it in order to know the full bitterness at the bottom until nothing was left save a few drops which I shall drink patiently I am not worthy of a new life of love and peace I am not strong enough for lifes pleasure and sweetness because a bird with broken wings cannot fly in the spacious sky The eyes that are accustomed to the dim light of a candle are not strong enough to stare at the sun Do not talk to me of happiness its memory makes me suffer Mention not peace to me its shadow frightens me but look at me and I will show you the holy torch which Heaven has lighted in the ashes of my heart you know that I love you as a mother loves her only child and Love only taught me to protect you even from myself It is Love purified with fire that stops me from following you to the farthest land Love kills my desires so that you may live freely and virtuously Limited love asks for possession of the beloved but the unlimited asks only for itself Love that comes between the naivete and awakening of youth satisfies itself with possessing and grows with embraces But Love which is born in the firmaments lap and has descended with the nights secrets is not contended with anything but Eternity and immortality it does not stand reverently before anything except deity When I knew that the Bishop wanted to stop me from leaving his nephews house and to take my only pleasure away from me I stood before the window of my room and looked toward the sea thinking of the vast countries beyond it and the real freedom and personal independence which can be found there I felt that I was living close to you surrounded by the shadow of your spirit submerged in the ocean of your affection But all these thoughts which illuminate a womans heart and make her rebel against old customs and live in the shadow of freedom and justice made me believe that I am weak and that our love is limited and feeble unable to stand before the suns face I cried like a king whose kingdom and treasure have been usurped but immediately I saw your face through my tears and your eyes gazing at me and I remembered what you said to me once Come Selma come and let us be strong towers before the tempest Let us stand like brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons If we are killed we shall die as martyrs and if we win we shall live as heroes Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility These words my beloved you uttered when the wings of death were hovering around my fathers bed I remembered them yesterday when the wings of despair were hovering above my head I strengthened myself and felt while in the darkness of my prison some sort of precious freedom easing our difficulties and diminishing our sorrows I found out that our love was as deep as the ocean and as high as the stars and as spacious as the sky I came here to see you and in my weak spirit there is a new strength and this strength is the ability to sacrifice a great thing in order to obtain a greater one it is the sacrifice of my happiness so that you may remain virtuous and honorable in the eyes of the people and be far away from their treachery and persecution In the past when I came to this place I felt as if heavy chains were pulling down on me but today I came here with a new determination that laughs at the shackles and shortens the way I used to come to this temple like a scared phantom but today I came like a brave woman who feels the urgency of sacrifice and knows the value of suffering a woman who likes to protect the one she loves from the ignorant people and from her hungry spirit I used to sit by you like a trembling shadow but today I came here to show you my true self before Ishtar and Christ I am a tree grown in the shade and today I stretched my branches to tremble for a while in the daylight I came here to tell you goodbye my beloved and it is my hope that our farewell will be great and awful like our love Let our farewell be like fire that bends the gold and makes it more resplendent Selma did not allow me to speak or protest but she looked at me her eyes glittering her face retaining its dignity seeming like an angel worthy of silence and respect Then she flung herself upon me something which she had never done before and put her smooth arms around me and printed a long deep fiery kiss on my lips As the sun went down withdrawing its rays from those gardens and orchards Selma moved to the middle of the temple and gazed along at its walls and corners as if she wanted to pour the light of her eyes on its pictures and symbols Then she walked forward and reverently knelt before the picture of Christ and kissed His feet and she whispered Oh Christ I have chosen Thy Cross and deserted Ishtars world of pleasure and happiness I have worn the wreath of thorns and discarded the wreath of laurel and washed myself with blood and tears instead of perfume and scent I have drunk vinegar and gall from a cup which was meant for wine and nectar accept me my Lord among Thy followers and lead me toward Galilee with those who have chosen Thee contended with their sufferings and delighted with their sorrows Then she rose and looked at me and said Now I shall return happily to my dark cave where horrible ghosts reside Do not sympathize with me my beloved and do not feel sorry for me because the soul that sees the shadow of God once will never be frightened thereafter of the ghosts of devils And the eye that looks on heaven once will not be closed by the pains of the world Uttering these words Selma left the place of worship and I remained there lost in a deep sea of thoughts absorbed in the world of revelation where God sits on the throne and the angels write down the acts of human beings and the souls recite the tragedy of life and the brides of Heaven sing the hymns of love sorrow and immortality Light had already come when I awakened from my swoon and found myself bewildered in the midst of the gardens repeating the echo of every word uttered by Selma and remembering her silence her actions her movements her expression and the touch of her hands until I realized the meaning of farewell and the pain of lonesomeness I was depressed and heartbroken It was my first discovery of the fact that men even if they are born free will remain slaves of strict laws enacted by their forefathers and that the firmament which we imagine as unchanging is the yielding of today to the will of tomorrow and submission of yesterday to the will of today Many a time since the night I have thought of the spiritual law which made Selma prefer death to life and many a time I have made a comparison between nobility of sacrifice and happiness of rebellion to find out which one is nobler and more beautiful but until now I have distilled only one truth out of the whole matter and this truth is sincerity which makes all our deeds beautiful and honorable And this sincerity was in Selma Karamy Five years of Selmas marriage passed without bringing children to strengthen the ties of spiritual relation between her and her husband and bind their repugnant souls together A barren woman is looked upon with disdain everywhere because of most mens desire to perpetuate themselves through posterity The substantial man considers his childless wife as an enemy he detests her and deserts her and wishes her death Mansour Bey Galib was that kind of man materially he was like earth and hard like steel and greedy like a grave His desire of having a child to carry on his name and reputation made him hate Selma in spite of her beauty and sweetness A tree grown in a cave does not bear fruit and Selma who lived in the shade of life did not bear children The nightingale does not make his nest in a cage lest slavery be the lot of its chicks Selma was a prisoner of misery and it was Heavens will that she would not have another prisoner to share her life The flowers of the field are the children of suns affection and natures love and the children of men are the flowers of love and compassion The spirit of love and compassion never dominated Selmas beautiful home at Ras Beyrouth nevertheless she knelt down on her knees every night before Heaven and asked God for a child in whom she would find comfort and consolation She prayed successively until Heaven answered her prayers The tree of the cave blossomed to bear fruit at last The nightingale in the cage commenced making its nest with the feathers of its wings Selma stretched her chained arms toward Heaven to receive Gods precious gift and nothing in the world could have made her happier than becoming a potential mother She waited anxiously counting the days and looking forward to the time when Heavens sweetest melody the voice of her child should ring in her ears She commenced to see the dawn of a brighter future through her tears It was the month of Nisan when Selma was stretched on the bed of pain and labor where life and death were wrestling The doctor and the midwife were ready to deliver to the world a new guest Late at night Selma started her successive cry a cry of lifes partition from life a cry of continuance in the firmament of nothingness… a cry of a weak force before the stillness of great forces the cry of poor Selma who was lying down in despair under the feet of life and death At dawn Selma gave birth to a baby boy When she opened her eyes she saw smiling faces all over the room then she looked again and saw life and death still wrestling by her bed She closed her eyes and cried saying for the first time Oh my son The midwife wrapped the infant with silk swaddles and placed him by his mother but the doctor kept looking at Selma and sorrowfully shaking his head The voices of joy woke the neighbors who rushed into the house to felicitate the father upon the birth of his heir but the doctor still gazed at Selma and her infant and shook his head The servants hurried to spread the good news to Mansour Bey but the doctor stared at Selma and her child with a disappointed look on his face As the sun came out Selma took the infant to her breast he opened his eyes for the first time and looked at his mother then he quivered and closed them for the last time The doctor took the child from Selmas arms and on his cheeks fell tears then he whispered to himself He is a departing guest The child passed away while the neighbors were celebrating with the father in the big hall at the house and drinking to the health of their heir and Selma looked at the doctor and pleaded Give me my child and let me embrace him Though the child was dead the sounds of the drinking cups increased in the hall He was born at dawn and died at sunrise He was born like a thought and died like a sigh and disappeared like a shadow He did not live to console and comfort his mother His life began at the end of the night and ended at the beginning of the day like a drop of few poured by the eyes of the dark and dried by the touch of the light A pearl brought by the tide to the coast and returned by the ebb into the depth of the sea A lily that has just blossomed from the bud of life and is mashed under the feet of death A dear guest whose appearance illuminated Selmas heart and whose departure killed her soul This is the life of men the life of nations the life of suns moons and stars And Selma focused her eyes upon the doctor and cried Give me my child and let me embrace him give me my child and let me nurse him Then the doctor bent his head His voice choked and he said Your child is dead Madame be patient Upon hearing her doctors announcement Selma uttered a terrible cry Then she was quiet for a moment and smiled happily Her face brightened as if she had discovered something and quietly she said Give me my child bring him close to me and let me see him dead The doctor carried the dead child to Selma and placed him between her arms She embraced him then turned her face toward the wall and addressed the dead infant saying You have come to take me away my child you have come to show me the way that leads to the coast Here I am my child lead me and let us leave this dark cave And in a minute the suns ray penetrated the window curtains and fell upon two calm bodies lying on a bed guarded by the profound dignity of silence and shaded by the wings of death The doctor left the room with tears in his eyes and as he reached the big hall the celebrations was converted into a funeral but Mansour Bey Galib never uttered a word or shed a tear He remained standing motionless like a statue holding a drinking cup with his right hand The second day Selma was shrouded with her white wedding dress and laid in a coffin the childs shroud was his swaddle his coffin was his mothers arms his grave was her calm breast Two corpses were carried in one coffin and I walked reverently with the crowd accompanying Selma and her infant to their resting place Arriving at the cemetery Bishop Galib commenced chanting while the other priests prayed and on their gloomy faces appeared a veil of ignorance and emptiness As the coffin went down one of the bystanders whispered This is the first time in my life I have seen two corpses in one coffin Another one said It seems as if the child had come to rescue his mother from her pitiless husband A third one said Look at Mansour Bey he is gazing at the sky as if his eyes were made of glass He does not look like he has lost his wife and child in one day A fourth one added His uncle the Bishop will marry him again tomorrow to a wealthier and stronger woman The Bishop and the priests kept on singing and chanting until the gravedigger was through filing the ditch Then the people individually approached the Bishop and his nephew and offered their respects to them with sweet words of sympathy but I stood lonely aside without a soul to console me as if Selma and her child meant nothing to me The farewellbidders left the cemetery the gravedigger stood by the new grave holding a shovel with his hand As I approached him I inquired Do you remember where Farris Effandi Karamy was buried He looked at me for a moment then pointed at Selmas grave and said Right here I placed his daughter upon him and upon his daughters breast rests her child and upon all I put the earth back with this shovel Then I said In this ditch you have also buried my heart As the gravedigger disappeared behind the poplar trees I could not resist anymore I dropped down on Selmas grave and wept There are in the Middle East today two challenging ideas old and new The old ideas will vanish because they are weak and exhausted There is in the Middle East an awakening that defies slumber This awakening will conquer because the sun is its leader and the dawn is its army In the fields of the Middle East which have been a large burial ground stand the youth of Spring calling the occupants of the sepulchers to rise and march toward the new frontiers When the Spring sings its hymns the dead of the winter rise shed their shrouds and march forward There is on the horizon of the Middle East a new awakening it is growing and expanding it is reaching and engulfing all sensitive intelligent souls it is penetrating and gaining all the sympathy of noble hearts The Middle East today has two masters One is deciding ordering being obeyed but he is at the point of death But the other one is silent in his conformity to law and order calmly awaiting justice he is a powerful giant who knows his own strength confident in his existence and a believer in his destiny There are today in the Middle East two men one of the past and one of the future Which one are you Come close let me look at you and let me be assured by your appearance and your conduct if you are one of those coming into the light or going into the darkness Come and tell me who and what are you Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what you can do for your country If you are the first then you are a parasite is the second then you are an oasis in a desert Are you a merchant utilizing the need of society for the necessities of life for monopoly and exorbitant profit Or a sincere hardworking and diligent man facilitating the exchange between the weaver and the farmer Are you charging a reasonable profit as a middleman between supply and demand If you are the first then you are a criminal whether you live in a palace or a prison If you are the second then you are a charitable man whether you are thanked or denounced by people Are you a religious leader weaving for your body a gown out of the ignorance of the people fashioning a crown out of the simplicity of their hearts and pretending to hate the devil merely to live upon his income Or are you a devout and a pious man who sees in the piety of the individual the foundation for a progressive nation and who can see through a profound search in the depth of his own soul a ladder to the eternal soul that directs the world If you are the first then you are a heretic a disbeliever in God even if you fast by day and pray by night If you are the second then you are a violet in the garden of truth even though its fragrance is lost upon the nostrils of humanity or whether its aroma rises into that rare air where the fragrance of flowers is preserved Are you a newspaperman who sells his idea and principle in the slave market who lives on the misery of people like a buzzard which descends only upon a decaying carcass Or are you a teacher on the platform of the city gathering experience from life and presenting it to the people as sermons you have learned If you are the first then you are a sore and an ulcer If you are the second then you are a balsam and a medicine Are you a governor who denigrates himself before those who appoint him and denigrates those whom he is to govern who never raises a hand unless it is to reach into pockets and who does not take a step unless it is for greed Or are you a faithful servant who serves only the welfare of the people If you are the first then you are as a tare in the threshing floor of the nations and if the second then you are a blessing upon its granaries Are you a husband who allows for himself what he disallows for his wife living in abandonment with the key of her prison in his boots gorging himself with his favorite food while she sits by herself before an empty dish Or are you a companion taking no action except hand in hand nor doing anything unless she gives her thoughts and opinions and sharing with her your happiness and success If you are the first then you are a remnant of a tribe which still dressing in the skins of animals vanished long before leaving the caves and if you are the second then you are a leader in a nation moving in the dawn toward the light of justice and wisdom Are you a searching writer full of selfadmiration keeping his head in the valley of a dusty past where the ages discarded the remnant of its clothes and useless ideas Or are you a clear thinker examining what is good and useful for society and spending your life in building what is useful and destroying what is harmful If you are the first then you are feeble and stupid and if you are the second then you are bread for the hungry and water for the thirsty Are you a poet who plays the tambourine at the doors of emirs or the one who throws the flowers during weddings and who walks in processions with a sponge full of warm water in his mouth a sponge to be pressed by his tongue and lips as soon as he reaches the cemetery Or have you a gift which God has placed in your hands on which to play heavenly melodies which draw our hearts toward the beautiful in life If you are the first then you are a juggler who evokes in our soul that which is contrary to what you intend If you are the second then you are love in our hearts and a vision in our minds In the Middle East there are two processions One procession is of old people waling with bent backs supported with bent canes they are out of breath though their path is downhill The other is a procession of young men running as if on winged feet and jubilant as with musical strings in their throats surmounting obstacles as if there were magnets drawing them up on the mountainside and magic enchating their hearts Which are you and in which procession do you move Ask yourself and meditate in the still of the night find if you are a slave of yesterday or free for the morrow I tell you that the children of yesteryears are walking in the funeral of the era that they created for themselves They are pulling a rotted rope that might break soon and cause them to drop into a forgotten abyss I say that they are living in homes with weak foundations as the storm blows and it is about to blow their homes will fall upon their heads and thus become their tombs I say that all their thoughts their sayings their quarrels their compositions their books and all their work are nothing but chains dragging them because they are too weak to pull the load But the children of tomorrow are the ones called by life and the follow it with steady steps and heads high they are the dawn of new frontiers no smoke will veil their eyes and no jingle of chains will drown out their voices They are few in number but the difference is as between a grain of wheat and a stack of hay No one knows them but they know each other They are like the summits which can see or hear each other not like caves which cannot hear or see They are the seed dropped by the hand of God in the field breaking through its pod and waving its sapling leaves before the face of the sun It shall grow into a mighty tree its root in the heart of the earth and its branches high in the sky I believe in you and I believe in your destiny I believe that you are contributors to this new civilization What do you seek my countrymen Do you desire that I build for You gorgeous palaces decorated With words of empty meaning or Temples roofed with dreams Or Do you command me to destroy what The liars and tyrants have built Shall I uproot with my fingers What the hypocrites and the wicked Have implanted Speak your insane Wish What is it you would have me do My countrymen Shall I purr like The kitten to satisfy you or roar Like the lion to please myself I Have sung for you but you did not Dance I have wept before you but You did not cry Shall I sing and Weep at the same time Your souls are suffering the pangs Of hunger and yet the fruit of Knowledge is more plentiful than The stones of the valleys Your hearts are withering from Thirst and yet the springs of Life are streaming about your Homes why do you not drink The sea has its ebb and flow The moon has its fullness and Crescents and the ages have Their winter and summer and all Things vary like the shadow of An unborn god moving between Earth and sun but truth cannot Be changed nor will it pass away Why then do you endeavour to Disfigure its countenance I have called you in the silence Of the night to point out the Glory of the moon and the dignity Of the stars but you startled From your slumber and clutched Your swords in fear crying Where is the enemy We must kill Him first At morningtide when The enemy came I called to you Again but now you did not wake From your slumber for you were Locked in fear wrestling with The processions of spectres in Your dreams And I said unto you Let us climb To the mountain top and view the Beauty of the world And you Answered me saying In the depths Of this valley our fathers lived And in its shadows they died and in Its caves they were buried How can We depart this place for one which They failed to honour And I said unto you Let us go to The plain that gives its bounty to The sea And you spoke timidly to Me saying The uproar of the abyss Will frighten our spirits and the Terror of the depths will deaden Our bodies I have loved you my countrymen but My love for you is painful to me And useless to you and today I Hate you and hatred is a flood That sweeps away the dry branches And quavering houses I have pitied your weakness my Countrymen but my pity has but Increased your feebleness exalting And nourishing slothfulness which Is vain to life And today I see Your infirmity which my soul loathes And fears I have cried over your humiliation And submission and my tears streamed Like crystalline but could not sear Away your stagnant weakness yet they Removed the veil from my eyes My tears have never reached your Petrified hearts but they cleansed The darkness from my inner self Today I am mocking at your suffering For laughter is a raging thunder that Precedes the tempest and never comes After it What do you desire my countrymen Do you wish for me to show you The ghost of your countenance on The face of still water Come Now and see how ugly you are Look and meditate Fear has Turned your hair grey as the Ashes and dissipation has grown Over your eyes and made them into Obscured hollows and cowardice Has touched your cheeks that now Appear as dismal pits in the Valley and death has kissed Your lips and left them yellow As the autumn leaves What is it that you seek my Countrymen What ask you from Life who does not any longer Count you among her children Your souls are freezing in the Clutches of the priests and Sorcerers and your bodies Tremble between the paws of the Despots and the shedders of Blood and your country quakes Under the marching feet of the Conquering enemy what may you Expect even though you stand Proudly before the face of the Sun Your swords are sheathed With rust and your spears are Broken and your shields are Laden with gaps why then do You stand in the field of battle Hypocrisy is your religion and Falsehood is your life and Nothingness is your ending why Then are you living Is not Death the sole comfort of the Miserable Life is a resolution that Accompanies youth and a diligence That follows maturity and a Wisdom that pursues senility but You my countrymen were born old And weak And your skins withered And your heads shrank whereupon You become as children running Into the mire and casting stones Upon each other Knowledge is a light enriching The warmth of life and all may Partake who seek it out but you My countrymen seek out darkness And flee the light awaiting the Coming of water from the rock And your nations misery is your Crime I do not forgive you Your sins for you know what you Are doing Humanity is a brilliant river Singing its way and carrying with It the mountains secrets into The heart of the sea but you My countrymen are stagnant Marshes infested with insects And vipers The spirit is a sacred blue Torch burning and devouring The dry plants and growing With the storm and illuminating The faces of the goddesses but You my countrymen your souls Are like ashes which the winds Scatter upon the snow and which The tempests disperse forever in The valleys Fear not the phantom of death My countrymen for his greatness And mercy will refuse to approach Your smallness and dread not the Dagger for it will decline to be Lodged in your shallow hearts I hate you my countrymen because You hate glory and greatness I Despise you because you despise Yourselves I am your enemy for You refuse to realize that you are The enemies of the goddesses The people looked upon Father Samaan as their guide in the field of spiritual and theological matters for he was an authority and a source of deep information on venial and mortal sins well versed in the secrets of paradise hell and purgatory Father Samaans mission in North Lebanon was to travel from one village to another preaching and curing the people from the spiritual disease of sin and saving them from the horrible trap of Satan The Reverend Father waged constant war with Satan The fellahin honoured and respected this clergyman and were always anxious to buy his advice or prayers with pieces of gold and silver and at every harvest they would present him with the finest fruits of their fields One evening in autumn as Father Samaan walked his way towards a solitary village crossing those valleys and hills he heard a painful cry emerging from a ditch at the side of the road He stopped and looked in the direction of the voice and saw an unclothed man lying on the ground Streams of blood oozed from deep wounds in his head and chest He was moaning painfully for aid saying Save me help me Have mercy on me I am dying Father Samaan looked with perplexity at the sufferer and said within himself This man must be a thief He probably tried to rob the wayfarers and failed Someone has wounded him and I fear that should he die I may be accused of having taken his life Having thus pondered the situation he resumed his journey whereupon the dying man stopped him calling out Do not leave me I am dying Then the Father meditated again and his face became pale as he realized he was refusing to help His lips quivered but he spoke to himself saying He must surely be one of the madmen wandering in the wilderness The sight of his wounds brings fear into my heart what shall I do Surely a spiritual doctor is not capable of treating fleshwounded bodies Father Samaan walked ahead a few paces when the nearcorpse uttered a painful plaint that melted the heart of the rock and he gasped Come close to me Come for we have been friends a long time You are Father Samaan the good shepherd and I am not a thief nor a madman Come close and do not let me die in this deserted place Come and I will tell you who I am Father Samaan came close to the man knelt and stared at him but he saw a strange face with contrasting features he saw intelligence with slyness ugliness with beauty and wickedness with softness He withdrew to his feet sharply and exclaimed Who are you With a fainting voice the dying man said Fear me not Father for we have been strong friends for long Help me to stand and take me to the nearby streamlet and cleanse my wounds with your linens And the Father inquired Tell me who you are for I do not know you nor even remember having seen you And the man replied with an agonizing voice You know my identity You have seen me one thousand times and you speak of me each day I am dearer to you than your own life And the Father reprimanded You are a lying imposter A dying man should tell the truth I have never seen your evil face in my entire life Tell me who you are or I will suffer you to die soaked in your escaping life And the wounded man moved slowly and looked into the clergymans eyes and upon his lips appeared a mystic smile and in a quiet deep and smooth voice he said I am Satan Upon hearing the fearful word Father Samaan uttered a terrible cry that shook the far corners of the valley then he stared and realized that the dying mans body with its grotesque distortions coincided with the likeness of Satan in a religious picture hanging on the wall of the village church He trembled and cried out saying God has shown me your hellish image and justly caused me to hate you cursed be you for evermore The mangled lamb must be destroyed by the shepherd lest he will infect the other lambs Satan answered Be not in haste Father and lose not this fleeting time in empty talk Come and close my wounds quickly before life departs from my body And the clergyman retorted The hands which offer a daily sacrifice to God shall not touch a body made of the secretion of hell You must die accursed by the tongues of the ages and the lips of humanity for you are the enemy of humanity and it is your avowed purpose to destroy all virtue Satan moved in anguish raising himself upon one elbow and responded You know not what you are saying nor understand the crime you are committing upon yourself Give heed for I will relate my story Today I walked alone in this solitary valley When I reached this place a group of angels descended to attack and struck me severely had it not been for one of them who carried a blazing sword with two sharp edges I would have driven them off but I had no power against the brilliant sword And Satan ceased talking for a moment as he pressed a shaking hand upon a deep wound in his side Then he continued The armed angel I believe he was Michael was an expert gladiator Had I not thrown myself to the friendly ground and feigned to have been slain he would have torn me into brutal death With voice of triumph and casting his eyes heavenwards the Father offered Blessed be Michaels name who has saved humanity from this vicious enemy And Satan protested My disdain for humanity is not greater than your hatred for yourself You are blessing Michael who never has come to your rescue You are cursing me in the hour of my defeat even though I was and still am the source of your tranquility and happiness You deny me your blessing and extend not your kindness but you live and prosper in the shadow of my being You have adopted my existence as an excuse and weapon for your career and you employ my name in justification for your deeds Has not my past caused you to be in need of my present and future Have you reached your goal in amassing the required wealth Have you found it impossible to extract more gold and silver from your followers using my kingdom as a threat Do you not realize that you will starve to death if I were to die What would you do tomorrow if you allowed me to die today What vocation would you pursue if my name disappeared For decades you have been roaming these villages and warning the people against falling into my hands They have bought your advice with their poor dinars and with the products of their land What would they buy from you tomorrow if they discovered that their wicked enemy no longer existed Your occupation would die with me for the people would be safe from sin As a clergyman do you not realize that Satans existence alone has created his enemy the Church That ancient conflict is the secret hand which removes the gold and silver from the faithfuls pocket and deposits it forever into the pouch of the preacher and the missionary How can you permit me to die here when you know it will surely cause you to lose your prestige your church your home and your livelihood Satan became silent for a moment and his humility was now converted into a confident independence and he continued Father you are proud but ignorant I will disclose to you the history of belief and in it you will find he truth which joins both of our beings and ties my existence with your very conscience In the first hour of the beginning of time man stood before the face of the sun and stretched forth his arms and cried for the first time saying Behind the sky there is a great and loving and benevolent God The man turned his back to the great circle of light and saw his shadow upon the earth and he hailed In the depths of the earth there is a dark evil who loves wickedness And the man walked towards his cave whispering to himself I am between two compelling forces one in whom I must take refuge and the other against whom I must struggle And the ages marched in procession while man existed between two powers one that he blessed because it exalted him and one that he cursed because it frightened him But he never perceived the meaning of a blessing or of a curse he was between the two like a tree between summer when it blooms and winter when it shivers When a man saw the dawn of civilization which is human understanding the family as a unit came into being Then came the tribes whereupon labour was divided according to ability and inclination one clan cultivated the land another built shelters others wove raiment or hunted food Subsequently divination made its appearance upon the earth and this was the first career adopted by man which possessed no essential urge or necessity Satan ceased talking for a moment Then he laughed and his mirth shook the empty valley but his laughter reminded him of his wounds and he placed his hand on his side suffering with pain He steadied himself and continued Divination appeared and grew on earth in strange fashion There was a man in the first tribe called La Wiss I know not the origin of his name He was an intelligent creature but extremely indolent and he detested work in the cultivation of land construction of shelters grazing of cattle or any pursuit requiring bodily movement or exertion And since food during that era could not be obtained except by arduous toil La Wiss slept many nights with an empty stomach One summer night as the members of that clan were gathered round the hut of their chief talking of the outcome of their day and waiting for their slumber time a man suddenly leaped to his feet pointed towards the moon and cried out saying Look at the night god His face is dark and his beauty has vanished and he has turned into a black stone hanging in the dome of the sky The multitude gazed at the moon shouted in awe and shook with fear as if the hands of darkness had clutched their hearts for they saw the night god slowly turning into a dark ball which changed the bright countenance of the earth and caused the hills and valleys before their eyes to disappear behind a black veil At that moment La Wiss who had seen an eclipse before and understood its simple cause stepped forward to make much of this opportunity He stood in the midst of the throng lifted his hands to the sky and in a strong voice he addressed them saying Kneel and pray for the evil god of obscurity is locked in struggle with the illuminating night god if the evil god conquers him we will all perish but if the night god triumphs over him we will remain alive Pray now and worship Cover your faces with earth Close your eyes and lift not your heads towards the sky for he who witnesses the two gods wrestling will lose his sight and mind and will remain blind and insane all his life Bend your heads low and with all your hearts urge the night god against his enemy who is our mortal enemy Thus did La Wiss continue talking using many cryptic words of his own fabrication which they had never heard After this crafty deception as the moon returned to its previous glory La Wiss raised his voice louder than before and said impressively Rise now and look at the night god who has triumphed over his evil enemy He is resuming his journey among the stars Let it be known that through your prayers you have helped him to overcome the devil of darkness He is well pleased now and brighter than ever The multitude rose and gazed at the moon that was shining in full beam Their fear became tranquility and their confusion was now joy They commenced dancing and singing and striking with their thick sticks upon sheets of iron filling the valleys with their clamour and shouting That night the chief of the tribe called La Wiss and spoke to him saying You have done something that no man has ever done You have demonstrated knowledge of a hidden secret that no other among us understands Reflecting the will of my people you are to be the highest ranking member after me in the tribe I am the strongest man and you are the wisest and most learned person You are the medium between our people and the gods whose desires and deeds you are to interpret and you will teach us those things necessary to gain their blessings and love And La Wiss slyly assured Everything the human god reveals to me in my divine dreams will be conveyed to you in awakeness and you may be confident that I will act directly between you and him The chief was assured and gave La Wiss two horses seven calves seventy sheep and seventy lambs and he spoke to him saying The men of the tribe shall build for you a strong house and we will give you at the end of each harvest season a part of the crop of the land so you may live as an honourable and respected master La Wiss rose and started to leave but the chief stopped him saying Who and what is the one whom you call the human god Who is this daring god who wrestles with the glorious night god We have never pondered him before La Wiss rubbed his forehead and answered him saying My honourable master in the olden time before the creation of man all the gods were living peacefully together in an upper world behind the vastness of the stars The god of gods was their father and knew what they did not know and did what they were unable to do He kept for himself the divine secrets that existed beyond the eternal laws During the seventh epoch of the twelfth age the spirit of Bahtaar who hated the great god revolted and stood before his father and said Why do you keep for yourself the power of great authority upon all creatures hiding away from us the secrets and laws of the universe Are we not your children who believe in you and share with you the great understanding and the perpetual being The god of gods became enraged and said I shall preserve for myself the primary power and the great authority and the essential secrets for I am the beginning and the end And Bahtaar answered him saying Unless you share with me your might and power I and my children and my childrens children will revolt against you At that moment the god of gods stood upon his throne in the deep heavens and drew forth a sword and grasped the sun as a shield and with a voice that shook all corners of the eternity he shouted out saying Descend you evil rebel to the dismal lower world where darkness and misery exist There you shall remain in exile wandering until the sun turns into ashes and the stars into dispersed particles In that hour Bahtaar descended from the upper world into the lower world where all the evil spirits dwelt Thereupon he swore by the secret of life that he would fight his father and brothers by trapping every soul who loved them As the chief listened his forehead wrinkled and his face turned pale He ventured Then the name of the evil god is Bahtaar and La Wiss responded His name was Bahtaar when he was in the upper world but when he entered into the lower world he adopted successively the names Baalzaboul Satanail Balial Zamiel Ahriman Mara Abdon Devil and finally Satan which is the most famous The chief repeated the word Satan many times with a quivering voice that sounded like the rustling of the dry branches at the passing of the wind then he asked Why does Satan hate man as much as he hates the gods And La Wiss responded quickly He hates man because man is a descendant of Satans brothers and sisters The chief exclaimed Then Satan is the cousin of man In a voice mingled with confusion and annoyance he retorted Yes master but he is their great enemy who fills their days with misery and their nights with horrible dreams He is the power who directs the tempest towards their hovels and brings famine upon their plantation and disease upon them and their animals He is an evil and powerful god he is wicked and he rejoices when we are in sorrow and he mourns when we are joyous We must through my konwledge examine him thoroughly in order to avoid his evil we must study his character so we will not step upon his trapladen path The chief leaned his head upon his thick stick and whispered saying I have learned now the inner secret of that strange power who directs the tempest towards our homes and brings the pestilence upon us and our cattle The people shall learn all that I have comprehended now and La Wiss will be blessed honoured and glorified for revealing to them the mystery of their powerful enemy and directing them away from the road of evil And La Wiss left the chief of the tribe and went to his retiring place happy over his ingenuity and intoxicated with the wine of his pleasure and fancy For the first time the chief and all the tribe except La Wiss spent the night slumbering in beds surrounded by horrible ghosts fearful spectres and disturbing dreams Satan ceased talking for a moment while Father Samaan stared at him as one bewildered and upon the Fathers lips appeared the sickly laughter of death Then Satan continued Thus divination came to this earth and thus was my existence the cause for its appearance La Wiss was the first who adopted my cruelty as a vocation After the death of La Wiss this occupation circulated through his children and prospered until it became a perfect and divine profession pursued by those whose minds are ripe with knowledge and whose souls are noble and whose hearts are pure and whose fancy is vast In Babylon the people bowed seven times in worshipping before a priest who fought me with his chantings In Nineveh they looked upon a man who claimed to have known my inner secrets as a golden link between God and man In Tibet they called the person who wrestled with me the son of the sun and moon In Byblus Ephesus and Antioch they offered their childrens lives in sacrifice to my opponents In Jerusalem and Rome they placed their lives in the hands of those who claimed they hated me and fought me with all their might In every city under the sun my name was the axis of the educational circle of religion arts and philosophy Had it not been for me no temples would have been built no towers or palaces would have been erected I am the courage that creates resolution in man I am the source that provokes originality of thought I am the hand that moves mans hands I am Satan everlasting I am Satan whom people fight in order to keep themselves alive If they cease struggling against me slothfulness will deaden their minds and hearts and souls in accordance with the weird penalties of their tremendous myth I am the enraged and mute tempest who agitates the minds of man and the hearts of women And in fear of me they will travel to places of worship to condemn me or to places of vice to make me happy by surrendering to my will The monk who prays in the silence of the night to keep me away from his bed is like the prostitute who invites me to her chamber I am Satan everlasting and eternal I am the builder of convents and monasteries upon the foundation of fear I build wine shops and wicked houses upon the foundations of lust and selfgratification If I cease to exist fear and enjoyment will be abolished from the world and through their disappearance desires and hopes will cease to exist in the human heart Life will become empty and cold like a harp with broken strings I am Satan everlasting I am the inspiration of falsehood slander treachery deceit and mockery and if these elements were to be removed from this world human society would become like a deserted field in which naught would thrive but thorns of virtue I am Satan everlasting I am the father and mother of sin and if sin were to vanish the fighters of sin would vanish with it along with their families and structures I am the heart of all evil Would you wish for human motion to stop through cessation of my heartbeat Would you accept the result after destroying the cause I am the cause Would you allow me to die in this deserted wilderness Do you desire to sever the bond that exists between you and me Answer me clergyman And Satan stretched his arms and bent his head forward and gasped deeply his face turned to grey and he resembled one of those Egyptian statues laid waste by the ages at the side of the Nile Then he fixed his glittering eyes upon Father Samaans face and said in a faltering voice I am tired and weak I did wrong by using my waning strength to speak on things you already know Now you may do as you please You may carry me to your home and treat my wounds or leave me in this place to die Father Samaan quivered and rubbed his hands nervously and with apology in his voice he said I know now what I had not known an hour ago Forgive my ignorance I know that your existence in this world creates temptation and temptation is a measurement by which God adjudges the value of human souls It is a scale which Almighty God uses to weigh the spirits I am certain that if you die temptation will die and with its passing death will destroy the ideal power which elevates and alerts man You must live for if you die and the people know it their fear of hell will vanish and they will cease worshipping for naught would be sin You must live for in your life is the salvation of humanity from vice and sin As to myself I shall sacrifice my hatred for you on the altar of my love for man Satan uttered a laugh that rocked the ground and he said What an intelligent person you are Father And what wonderful knowledge you possess in theological facts You have found through the power of your knowledge a purpose for my existence which I had never understood and now we realize our need for each other Come close to me my brother darkness is submerging the plains and half of my blood has escaped upon the sand of this valley and naught remains of me but the remnants of a broken body which death shall soon buy unless you render aid Father Samaan rolled the sleeves of his robe and approached and lifted Satan to his back and walked towards his home In the midst of those valleys engulfed with silence and embellished with the veil of darkness Father Samaan walked towards the village with his back bent under his heavy burden His black raiment and long beard were spattered with blood streaming from above him but he struggled forward his lips moving in fervent prayer for the life of the dying Satan Your thought is a tree rooted deep in the soil of tradition and whose branches grow in the power of continuity My thought is a cloud moving in the space It turns into drops which as they fall form a brook that sings its way into the sea Then it rises as vapour into the sky Your thought is a fortress that neither gale nor the lightning can shake My thought is a tender leaf that sways in every direction and finds pleasure in its swaying Your thought is an ancient dogma that cannot change you nor can you change it My thought is new and it tests me and I test it morn and eve You have your thought and I have mine Your thought allows you to believe in the unequal contest of the strong against the weak and in the tricking of the simple by the subtle ones My thought creates in me the desire to till the earth with my hoe and harvest the crops with my sickle and build my home with stones and mortar and weave my raiment with woollen and linen threads Your thought urges you to marry wealth and notability Mine commends selfreliance Your thought advocates fame and show Mine counsels me and implores me to cast aside notoriety and treat it like a grain of sand cast upon the shore of eternity Your thought instils in your heart arrogance and superiority Mine plants within me love for peace and the desire for independence Your thought begets dreams of palaces with furniture of sandalwood studded with jewels and beds made of twisted silk threads My thought speaks softly in my ears “Be clean in body and spirit even if you have nowhere to lay your head” Your thought makes you aspire to titles and offices Mine exhorts me to humble service You have your thought and I have mine Your thought is social science a religious and political dictionary Mine is simple axiom Your thought speaks of the beautiful woman the ugly the virtuous the prostitute the intelligent and the stupid Mine sees in every woman a mother a sister or a daughter of every man The subjects of your thought are thieves criminals and assassins Mine declares that thieves are the creatures of monopoly criminals are the offspring of tyrants and assassins are akin to the slain Your thought describes laws courts judges punishments Mine explains that when man makes a law he either violates it or obeys it If there is a basic law we are all one before it He who disdains the mean is himself mean He who vaunts his scorn of the sinful vaunts his disdain of all humanity Your thought concerns the skilled the artist the intellectual the philosopher the priest Mine speaks of the loving and the affectionate the sincere the honest the forthright the kindly and the martyr Your thought advocates Judaism Brahmanism Buddhism Christianity and Islam In my thought there is only one universal religion whose varied paths are but the fingers of the loving hand of the Supreme Being In your thought there are the rich the poor and the beggared My thought holds that there are no riches but life that we are all beggars and no benefactor exists save life herself You have your thought and I have mine According to your thought the greatness of nations lies in their politics their parties their conferences their alliances and treaties But mine proclaims that the importance of nations lies in work – work in the field work in the vineyards work with the loom work in the tannery work in the quarry work in the timberyard work in the office and in the press Your thought holds that the glory of the nations is in their heroes It sings the praises of Rameses Alexander Caesar Hannibal and Napoleon But mine claims that the real heroes are Confucius LaoTse Socrates Plato Abi Taleb El Gazali Jalal Eddinel Roumy Copernicus and Pasteur Your thought sees power in armies cannons battleships submarines aeroplanes and poison gas But mine asserts that power lies in reason resolution and truth No matter how long the tyrant endures he will be the loser at the end Your thought differentiates between pragmatist and idealist between the part and the whole between the mystic and materialist Mine realizes that life is one and its weights measures and tables do not coincide with your weights measures and tables He whom you suppose an idealist may be a practical man You have your thought and I have mine Your thought is interested in ruins and museums mummies and petrified objects But mine hovers in the everrenewed haze and clouds Your thought is enthroned on skulls Since you take pride in it you glorify it too My thought wanders in the obscure and distant valleys Your thought trumpets while you dance Mine prefers the anguish of death to your music and dancing Your thought is the thought of gossip and false pleasure Mine is the thought of him who is lost in his own country of the alien in his own nation of the solitary among his kinfolk and friends You have your thought and I have mine Give me the Nay and sing he secret song of eternity The laments of the Nay will linger beyond the decline of existence Have you like me Chosen the forest dwelling Rather than the castle Have you followed the stream And climbed the rocks Have you anointed your body With fragrance distilled in light Have you been drunk with dawn In the goblets full of pure air Have you like me Sat down at dusk Among the glowing languor Of vines laden with grapes Have you lain down on the grass at night And covered yourself with heavens Opening your heart to the future Forgetful of the past Give me the Nay and sing The song in tune with hearts The laments of the Nay will linger Beyond the fading of sins Give me the Nay and sing Unmindful of troubles and cures For each man Is nothing more than a watercolor sketch By the side of a rivulet that meandered among the rocks at the foot of Lebanons Mountain sat a shepherdess surrounded by her flock of lean sheep grazing upon dry grass She looked into the distant twilight as if the future were passing before her Tears had jeweled her eyes like dewdrops adorning flowers Sorrow had caused her lips to open that it might enter and occupy her sighing heart After sunset as the knolls and hills wrapped themselves in shadow History stood before the maiden He was an old man whose white hair fell like snow over his breast and shoulders and in his right hand he held a sharp sickle In a voice like the roaring sea he said “Peace unto you Syria” The virgin rose trembling with fear “What do you wish of me History” she asked Then she pointed to her sheep “This is the remnant of a healthy flock that once filled this valley This is all that your covetousness has left me Have you come now to sate your greed on that” “These plains that were once so fertile have been trodden to barren dust by your trampling feet My cattle that once grazed upon flowers and produced rich milk now gnaw at thistles that leave them gaunt and dry “Fear God oh History and afflict me no more The sight of you has made me detest life and the cruelty of your sickle has caused me to love Death “Leave me in my solitude to drain the cup of sorrow—my best wine Go History to the West where Lifes wedding feast is being celebrated Here let me lament the bereavement you have prepared for me Concealing his sickle under the folds of his garment History looked upon her as a loving father looks upon his child and said “Oh Syria what I have taken from you were my own gifts Know that you sisternations are entitled to a part of the glory which was yours I must give to them what I gave you Your plight is like that of Egypt Persia and Greece for each one of them also has a lean flock and dry pasture Oh Syria that which you call degradation is an indispensable sleep from which you will draw strength The flower does not return to life save through death and love does not grow except after separation” The old man came close to the maiden stretched forth his hand and said “Shake my hand oh Daughter of the Prophets” And she shook his hand and looked at him from behind a screen of tears and said “Farewell History farewell” And he responded “Until we meet again Syria until we meet again” And the old man disappeared like swift lightning and the shepherdess called her sheep and started on her way saying to herself “Shall there be another meeting” I AM for ever walking upon these shores Betwixt the sand and the foam The high tide will erase my footprints And the wind will blow away the foam But the sea and the shore will remain For ever Once I filled my hand with mist Then I opened it and lo the mist was a worm And I closed and opened my hand again and behold there was a bird And again I closed and opened my hand and in Its hollow stood a man with a sad face turned upward And again I closed my hand and when I opened it there was naught but mist But I heard a song of exceeding sweetness It was but yesterday I thought myself a fragment quivering without rhythm in the sphere of life Now I know that I am the sphere and all life in rhythmic fragments moves within me They say to me in their awakening You and the world you live in are but a grain of sand upon the infinite shore of an infinite sea And in my dream I say to them I am the infinite sea and all worlds are but grains of sand upon my shore Only once have I been made mute It was when a man asked me Who are you The first thought of God was an angel The first word of God was a man We were fluttering wandering longing creatures a thousand thousand years before the sea and the wind in the forest gave us words Now how can we express the ancient of days in us with only the sounds of our yesterdays The Sphinx spoke only once and the Sphinx said A grain of sand is a desert and a desert is a grain of sand and now let us be silent again I heard the Sphinx but I did not understand Once I saw the face of a woman and I beheld all her children not yet born And a woman looked upon my face and she knew all my forefathers dead before she was born Now would I fulfil myself But how shall I unless I become a planet with intelligent lives dwelling upon it Is not this every mans goal A pearl is a temple built by pain around a grain of sand What longing built our bodies and around what grains When God threw me a pebble into this wondrous lake disturbed its surface with countless circles But when I reached the depths I became very still Give me silence and I will outdare the night I had a second birth when my soul and my body loved one another and were married Once I knew a man whose ears were exceedingly keen but he was dumb He had lost his tongue in a battle I know now what battles that man fought before the great silence came I am glad he is dead The world Is not large enough for two of us Long did I lie in the dust of Egypt silent and unaware of the seasons Then the sun gave me birth and I rose and walked upon the banks of the Nile Singing with the days and dreaming with the nights And now the sun treads upon me with a thousand feet that I may lie again in the dust of Egypt But behold a marvel and a riddle The very sun that gathered me cannot scatter me Still erect am I and sure of foot do I walk upon the banks of the Nile Remembrance Is a form of meeting Forgetfulness Is a form of freedom We measure time according to the movement of countless suns and they measure time by little machines in their little pockets Now tell me how could we ever meet at the same place and the same time Space is not space between the earth and the sun to one who looks down from the windows of the Milky Way Humanity is a river of light running from exeternity to eternity Do not the spirits who dwell in the ether envy man his pain On my way to the Holy City I met another pilgrim and I asked him Is this indeed the way to the Holy City And he said Follow me and you will reach the Holy City in a day and a night And I followed him And we walked many days and many nights yet we did not reach the Holy City And what was to my surprise he became angry with me because he had misled me Make me O God the prey of the lion ere You make the rabbit my prey One may not reach the dawn save by the path of the night My house says to me Do not leave me for here dwells your past And the road says to me Come and follow me for I am your future And I say to both my house and the road I have no past nor have I a future If I stay here there is a going in my staying and if I go there Is a staying in my going Only love and death change all things How can I lose faith in the justice of life when the dreams of those who sleep upon feathers are not more beautiful than the dreams of those who sleep upon the earth Strange the desire for certain pleasures is a part of my pain Seven times have I despised my soul The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy and she chose the easy The fourth time when she committed a wrong and comforted herself that others also commit wrong The fifth time when she forbore for weakness and attributed her patience to strength The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face and knew not that it was one of her own masks And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise and deemed It a virtue I am ignorant of absolute truth But I am humble before my ignorance and therein lies my honour and my reward There is a space between mans imagination and mans attainment that may only be traversed by his longing Paradise is there behind that door in the next room but I have lost the key Perhaps I have only mislaid it You are blind and I am deaf and dumb so let us touch hands and understand The significance of man is not in what he attains but rather in what he longs to attain Some of us are like ink and some like paper And if it were not for the blackness of of us some of us would be dumb And if it were not for the whiteness of some of us some of us would be blind Give me an ear and I will give you a voice Our mind is a sponge our heart is a stream Is it not strange that most of us choose sucking rather than running When you long for blessings that you may not name and when you grieve knowing not the cause then indeed you are growing with all things that grow and rising toward your greater self When one Is drunk with a vision he deems his faint expression of it the very wine You drink wine that you may be intoxicated and I drink that it may sober me from that other wine When my cup is empty I resign myself to its emptiness but when it is half full I resent its halffullness The reality of the other person is not in what he reveals to you but in what he cannot reveal to you Therefore if you would understand him listen not to what he says but rather to what he does not say Half of what I say is meaningless but I say it so that the other half may reach you A sense of humour is a sense of proportion My loneliness was born when men praised my talkative faults and blamed my silent virtues When Life does not find a singer to sing her heart she produces a philosopher to speak her mind A truth is to be known always to be uttered sometimes The real in us is silent the acquired is talkative The voice of life in me cannot reach the ear of life in you but let us talk that we may not feel lonely When two women talk they say nothing when one woman speaks she reveals all of life Frogs may bellow louder than bulls but they cannot drag the plough in the field nor turn the wheel of the winepress and of their skins you cannot make shoes Only the dumb envy the talkative If winter should say Spring is in my heart who would believe winter Every seed Is a longing Should you really open your eyes and see you would behold your image in all images And should you open your ears and listen you would hear your voice in all voices It takes two of us to discover truth one to utter it and one to understand it Though the wave of words is for ever upon us yet our depth is for ever silent Many a doctrine is like a window pane We see truth through it but it divides us from truth Now let us play hide and seek Should you hide in my heart it would not be difficult to find you But should you hide behind your own shell then it would be useless for anyone to seek you A woman may veil her face with a smile How noble is the sad heart who would sing a joyous song with joyous hearts He who would understand a woman or dissect genius or solve the mystery of silence is the very man who would wake from a beautiful dream to sit at a breakfast table I would walk with all those who walk I would not stand still to watch the procession passing by You owe more than gold to him who serves you Give him of your heart or serve him Nay we have not lived in vain Have they not built towers of our bones Let us not be particular and sectional The mind and the scorpions tail rise in glory from the same earth Every dragon gives birth to a St George who slays it Trees are poems that the earth writes upon the sky We fell them down and turn them into paper that we may record our emptiness Should you care to write and only the saints know why you should you must needs have knowledge and art and magic—the knowledge of the music of words the art of being artless and the magic of loving your readers They dip their pens in our hearts and think they are inspired Should a tree write its autobiography it would not be unlike the history of a race If I were to choose between the power of writing a poem and the ecstasy of a poem un written I would choose the ecstasy It is better poetry But you and all my neighbours agree that I always choose badly Poetry is not an opinion expressed It is a song that rises from a bleeding wound or a smiling mouth Words are timeless You should utter them or write them with a knowledge of their timelessness A poet is a dethroned king sitting among the ashes of his palace trying to fashion an image out of the ashes Poetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder with a dash of the dictionary In vain shall a poet seek the mother of the songs of his heart Once I said to a poet We shall not know your worth until you die And he answered saying Yes death is always the revealer And if indeed you would know my worth it is that I have more in my heart than upon my tongue and more in my desire than in my hand If you sing of beauty though alone in the heart of the desert you will have an audience Poetry is wisdom that enchants the heart Wisdom is poetry that sings in the mind If we could enchant mans heart and at the same time sing in his mind then in truth he would live in the shadow of God Inspiration will always sing inspiration will never explain We often sing lullabies to our children that we ourselves may sleep All our words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of the mind Thinking is always the stumbling stone to poetry A great singer is he who sings our silences How can you sing if your mouth be filled with food How shall your hand be raised in blessing if it is filled with gold They say the nightingale pierces his bosom with a thorn when he sings a love song So do we all How else should we sing Genius is but a robins song at the beginning of a slow spring Even the most winged spirit cannot escape physical necessity A madman is not less a musician than you or myself only the instrument on which he plays is a little out of tune The song that lies silent in the heart of a mother sings upon the lips of her child No longing remains unfulfilled I have never agreed with my other self wholly The truth of the matter seems to lie between us Your other self is always sorry for you But your other self grows on sorrow so all is well There is no struggle of soul and body save in the minds of those whose souls are asleep and whose bodies are out of tune When you reach the heart of life you shall find beauty in all things even in the eyes that are blind to beauty We live only to discover beauty All else is a form of waiting Sow a seed and the earth will yield you a flower Dream your dream to the sky and it will bring you your beloved The devil died the very day you were born Now you do not have to go through hell to meet an angel Many a woman borrows a mans heart very few could possess it If you would possess you must not claim When a mans hand touches the hand of a woman they both touch the heart of eternity Love is the veil between lover and lover Every man loves two women the one is the creation of his imagination and the other is not yet born Men who do not forgive women their little faults will never enjoy their great virtues Love that does not renew itself every day becomes a habit and in turn a slavery Lovers embrace that which is between them rather than each other Love and doubt have never been on speaking terms Love is a word of light written by a hand of light upon a page of light Friendship is always a sweet responsibility never an opportunity If you do not understand your friend under all conditions you will never understand him Your most radiant garment is of the other persons weaving Your most savoury meal is that which you eat at the other persons table Your most comfortable bed is in the other persons house Now tell me how can you separate yourself from the other person Your mind and my heart will never agree until your mind ceases to live in numbers and my heart in the mist We shall never understand one another until we reduce the language to seven words How shall my heart be unsealed unless it be broken Only great sorrow or great joy can reveal your truth If you would be revealed you must either dance naked in the sun or carry your cross Should Nature heed what we say of contentment no river would seek the sea and no winter would turn to spring Should she heed all we say of thrift how many of us would be breathing this air You see but your shadow when you turn your back to the sun You are free before the sun of the day and free before the stars of the night And you are free when there is no sun and no moon and no star You are even free when you close your eyes upon all there Is But you are a slave to him whom you love because you love him And a slave to him who loves you because he loves you We are all beggars at the gate of the temple and each one of us receives his share of the bounty of the King when he enters the temple and when he goes out But we are all jealous of one another which is another way of belittling the King You cannot consume beyond your appetite The other half of the loaf belongs to the other person and there should remain a little bread for the chance guest If it were not for guests all houses would be graves Said a gracious wolf to a simple sheep Will you not honour our house with a visit And the sheep answered We would have been honoured to visit your house if it were not in your stomach I stopped my guest on the threshold and said Nay wipe not your feet as you enter but as you go out Generosity is not in giving me that which I need more than you do but it is in giving me that which you need more than I do You are indeed charitable when you give and while giving turn your face away so that you may not see the shyness of the receiver The difference between the richest man and the poorest is but a day of hunger and an hour of thirst We often borrow from our tomorrows to pay our debts to our yesterdays I too am visited by angels and devils but I get rid of them When it is an angel I pray an old prayer and he is bored When it is a devil I commit an old sin and he passes me by After all this not a bad prison but I do not like this wall between my cell and the next prisoners cell Yet I assure you that I do not wish to reproach the warder nor the Builder of the prison Those who give you a serpent when you ask for a fish may have nothing but serpents to give It is then generosity on their part Trickery succeeds sometimes but it always commits suicide You are truly a forgiver when you forgive murderers who never spill blood thieves who never steal and liars who utter no falsehood He who can put his finger upon that which divides good from evil is he who can touch the very hem of the garment of God If your heart is a volcano how shall you expect flowers to bloom in your hands A strange form of selfindulgence There are times when I would be wronged and cheated that I may laugh at the expense of those who think I do not know I am being wronged and cheated What shall I say of him who is the pursuer playing the part of the pursued Let him who wipes his soiled hands with your garment take your garment He may need it again surely you would not It is a pity that moneychangers cannot be good gardeners Please do not whitewash your inherent faults with your acquired virtues I would have the faults they are like mine own How often have I attributed to myself crimes I have never committed so that the other person may feel comfortable in my presence Even the masks of life are masks of deeper mystery You may judge others only according to your knowledge of yourself Tell me now who among us is guilty and who is unguilty The truly just is he who feels half guilty of your misdeeds Only an idiot and a genius break manmade laws and they are the nearest to the heart of God It is only when you are pursued that you become swift I have no enemies O God but if I am to have an enemy Let his strength be equal to mine That truth alone may be the victor You will be quite friendly with your enemy when you both die Perhaps a man may commit suicide in selfdefence Long ago there lived a Man who was crucified for being too loving and too lovable And strange to relate I met Him thrice yesterday The first time He was asking a policeman not to take a prostitute to prison the second time He was drinking wine with an outcast and the third time He was having a fistfight with a promoter inside a church If all they say of good and evil were true then my life is but one long crime Pity is but half justice The only one who has been unjust to me is the one to whose brother I have been unjust When you see a man led to prison say in your heart Mayhap he is escaping from a narrower prison And when you see a man drunken say in your heart Mayhap he sought escape from something still more unbeautiful Oftentimes I have hated in selfdefence but if I were stronger I would not have used such a weapon How stupid is he who would patch the hatred in his eyes with the smile of his lips Only those beneath me can envy or hate me I have never been envied or hated I am above no one Only those above me can praise or belittle me I have never been praised nor belittled I am below no one Your saying to me I do not understand you is praise beyond my worth and an insult you do not deserve How mean am I when life gives me gold and I give you silver and yet I deem myself generous When you reach the heart of life you will find yourself not higher than the felon and not lower than the prophet Strange that you should pity the slow footed and not the slowminded And the blindeyed rather than the blindhearted It is wiser for the lame not to break his crutches upon the head of his enemy How blind is he who gives you out of his pocket that he may take out of your heart Life is a procession The slow of foot finds it too swift and he steps out And the swift of foot finds it too slow and he too steps out If there is such a thing as sin some of us commit it backward following our forefathers footsteps And some of us commit it forward by over ruling our children The truly good is he who is one with all those who are deemed bad We are all prisoners but some of us are in cells with windows and some without Strange that we all defend our wrongs with more vigour than we do our rights Should we all confess our sins to one another we would all laugh at one another for our lack of originality Should we all reveal our virtues we would also laugh for the same cause An individual is above manmade laws until he commits a crime against manmade conventions After that he is neither above anyone nor lower than anyone Government is an agreement between you and myself You and myself are often wrong Crime is either another name of need or an aspect of a disease Is there a greater fault than being conscious of the other persons faults If the other person laughs at you you can pity him but if you laugh at him you may never forgive yourself If the other person injures you you may forget the injury but if you injure him you will always remember In truth the other person is your most sensitive self given another body How heedless you are when you would have men fly with your wings and you cannot even give them a feather Once a man sat at my board and ate my bread and drank my wine and went away laughing at me Then he came again for bread and wine and I spurned him And the angels laughed at me Hate is a dead thing Who of you would be a tomb It is the honour of the murdered that he is not the murderer The tribune of humanity is in its silent heart never its talkative mind They deem me mad because I will not sell my days for gold And I deem them mad because they think my days have a price They spread before us their richest of gold and silver of ivory and ebony and we spread before them our hearts and our spirits And yet they deem themselves the hosts and us the guests I would be the least among men with dreams and the desire to fulfil them rather than the greatest with no dreams and no desires The most pitiful among men is he who turns his dreams into silver and gold We are all climbing toward the summit of our hearts desire Should the other climber steal your sack and your purse and wax fat on the one and heavy on the other you should pity him The climbing will be harder for his flesh and the burden will make his way longer And should you in your leanness see his flesh puffing upward help him a step it will add to your swiftness You cannot judge any man beyond your knowledge of him and how small is your knowledge I would not listen to a conqueror preaching to the conquered The truly free man is he who bears the load of the bond slave patiently A thousand years ago my neighbour said to me I hate life for it is naught but a thing of pain And yesterday I passed by a cemetery and saw life dancing upon his grave Strife in nature is but disorder longing for order Solitude is a silent storm that breaks down all our dead branches Yet it sends our living roots deeper into the living heart of the living earth Once I of the sea to a brook and the brook thought me but an imaginative exaggerator And once I spoke of a brook to the sea the sea thought me but a depreciative defamer How narrow is the vision that exalts the busyness of the ant above the singing of the grasshopper The highest virtue here may be the least in another world The deep and the high go to the depth or to the height in a straight line only the spacious can move in circles If it were not for our conception of weights and measures we would stand in awe of the firefly as we do before the sun A scientist without imagination is a butcher with dull knives and outworn scales But what would you since we are not all vegetarians When you sing the hungry hears you with his stomach Death is not nearer to the aged than to the newborn neither is life If indeed you must be candid be candid beautifully otherwise keep silent for there is a man in our neighbourhood who is dying Mayhap a funeral among men is a wedding feast among the angels A forgotten reality may die and leave in its will seven actualities facts to be spent in its funeral and the building of a tomb In truth we talk only to ourselves but sometimes we talk loud enough that others may hear us The obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply If the Milky Way were not within me how should I have seen it or known it Unless I am a physician among physicians they would not believe that I am an astronomer Perhaps the seas definition of a shell is the pearl Perhaps times definition of coal is the diamond Fame is the shadow of passion standing in the light A root is a flower that disdains fame There is neither religion nor science beyond beauty Every great man I have known had some thing small in his makeup and it was that small something which prevented inactivity or madness or suicide The truly great man is he who would master no one and who would be mastered by none I would not believe that man is mediocre simply because he kills the criminals the prophets Tolerance is love sick with the sickness of haughtiness Worms will turn but is it not strange that even elephants will yield A disagreement may be the shortest cut between two minds I am the flame and I am the dry brush and one part of me consumes the other part We are all seeking the summit of the holy mountain but not our road be shorter if we consider the past a chart and not a guide Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep too grave to laugh too selfful to see other than itself Had I filled myself with all that you know what room should I have for all that you do not know I have learned silence from the talkative toleration from the intolerant and kindness from the unkind yet strange I am ungrateful to these teachers A bigot is a stonedeaf orator The silence of the envious is too noisy When you reach the end of what you should know you will be at the beginning of what you should sense An exaggeration is a truth that has lost its temper If you can see only what light reveals hear only what sound announces Then In truth you do not see nor do you hear A fact is a truth unsexed You cannot laugh and be unkind at the same time The nearest to my heart are a king without a kingdom and a poor man who does not know how to beg A shy failure is nobler than an immodest success Dig anywhere in the earth and you will find a treasure only you must dig with the faith of a peasant Said a hunted fox followed by twenty horsemen and a pack of twenty hounds Of course they will kill me But how poor and how stupid they must be Surely it would not be worth while for twenty foxes riding on twenty asses and accompanied by twenty wolves to chase and kill one man It is the mind in us that yields to the laws made by us but never the spirit in us A traveller am I and a navigator and every day I discover a new region within my soul A woman protested saying Of course it was a righteous war My son fell in it I said to Life I would hear Death speak And Life raised her voice a little higher said You hear him now When you have solved ail the mysteries of life you long for death for it is but another mystery of life Birth and death are the two noblest expressions of bravery My friend you and I shall remain strangers unto life And unto one another and each unto himself Until the day when you shall speak and I shall listen Deeming your voice my own voice And when I shall stand before you Thinking myself standing before a mirror They say to me Should you know yourself you would know all men And I say Only when I seek all men shall I know myself Man is two men one is awake in darkness the other is asleep In light A hermit is one who renounces the world of fragments that he may enjoy the world wholly and without interruption There lies a green field between the scholar and the poet should the scholar cross it he becomes a wise man should the poet cross it he becomes a prophet Yestereve I saw philosophers in the market place carrying their heads in crying aloud Wisdom Wisdom for sale Poor philosophers They sell their heads to feed their hearts Said a philosopher to a street sweeper I pity you Yours is a hard dirty task And the street sweeper said Thank you sir But tell me what is your task And the philosopher answered saying I study mans mind his deeds his desires Then the street sweeper went on with his sweeping and said with a smile I pity you too He who listens to truth Is not less than he who utters truth No man can draw the line between necessities and luxuries Only the angels can do that and the angels are wise and wistful Perhaps the angels are our better thoughts in space He is the true prince who finds his throne in the heart of the dervish Generosity is giving more than you can and pride is taking less than you need In truth you owe naught to any man You all to all men All those who have lived in the past live with us now Surely none of us would be an ungracious host He who longs the most lives the longest They say to me A bird In the hand is worth ten In the bush But I say A bird and a feather in the bush is worth more than ten birds in the hand Your seeking after that feather is life with winged feet nay it is life Itself There are only two elements here beauty and truth beauty in the hearts of lovers and truth in the arms of the tillers of the soil Great beauty captures me but a beauty still greater frees me even from itself Beauty shines brighter in the heart of him who longs for it than in the eyes of him who sees it I admire the man who reveals his mind to me I honour him who unveils his dreams But why am I shy and even a little ashamed before him who serves me The gifted were once proud in serving princes Now they claim honour in serving paupers The angels know too many practical men eat bread with the sweat of the dreamers brow Wit is often a mask If you could tear it you would either a genius irritated or cleverness juggling The understanding attributes to me understanding and the dull dullness I think they are right Only those with secrets in their hearts could divine the secrets in our hearts He who would share your pleasure but not your pain shall lose the key to one of the seven gates of Paradise Yes there is a Nirvanah it is in leading your sheep to a green pasture and in putting your child to sleep and in writing the last line of your poem We choose our joys and our sorrows long before we experience them Sadness is but a wall between two gardens When either your joy or your sorrow becomes great the world becomes small Desire is half of life indifference is half of death The bitterest thing In our todays sorrow is the memory of our yesterdays joy They say to me You must needs choose between the pleasures of this world and the peace of the next world And I say to them I have chosen both the delights of this world and the peace of the next For I know in my heart that the Supreme Poet wrote but one poem it scans perfectly it rhymes perfectly Faith is an oasis in the heart which will never be reached by the caravan of thinking When you reach your height you shall desire but only for desire and you shall hunger for hunger and you shall thirst for greater thirst If you reveal your secrets to the wind you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees The flowers of spring are winters dreams related at the breakfast table of the angels Said a skunk to a tuberose See how swiftly I run while you cannot walk nor even creep Said the tuberose to the skunk Oh noble swift runner please run swiftly Turtles can tell more about the roads than hares Strange that creatures without backbones have the hardest shells The most talkative Is the least intelligent and there is hardly a difference between an orator and an auctioneer Be grateful that you do not have to live down the renown of a father nor the wealth of an uncle But above all be grateful that no one will have to live down either your renown or your wealth Only when a juggler misses catching his ball does he appeal to me The envious praises me unknowingly Long were you a a dream in your mothers sleep and then she woke to give you birth The germ of the race is in your mothers longing My father and mother desired a child and they begot me And I wanted a mother and a father and I begot night and the sea Some of our children are our justifications and some are but our regrets When night comes and you too are dark lie down and be dark with a will And when morning comes and you are still dark stand up and say to the day with a will I am still dark It is stupid to play a role with the night and the day They would both laugh at you The mountain veiled in mist is not a hill an oak tree in the rain is not a weeping willow Behold here is a paradox the deep and high are nearer to one another than the midlever to either When I stood a clear mirror before you you gazed into me and saw your image Then you said I love you But in truth you loved yourself in me When you enjoy loving your neighbour it ceases to be a virtue Love which is not always springing is always dying You cannot have youth and the knowledge of it at the same time For youth is too busy living to know and knowledge is too busy seeking itself to live You may sit at your window watching the passersby And watching you may see a nun walking toward your right hand and a prostitute toward your left hand And you may say in your innocence How noble is the one and how ignoble is the other And should you close your eyes and listen awhile you would hear a voice whispering in the ether One seeks me in prayer and the other in pain And in the spirit of each there is a bower for my spirit Once every hundred years Jesus of Nazareth meets Jesus of the Christian in a garden among the hills of Lebanon And they talk long and each time Jesus of Nazareth goes away saying to Jesus of the Christian My friend I fear we shall never never agree May God feed the overabundant A great man has two hearts one bleeds the other forbears Should one tell a He which does not hurt you nor anyone else why not say in your heart that the house of his facts is too small for his fancies and he had to leave it for larger space Behind every closed door is a mystery sealed with seven seals Waiting is the hoofs of time What if trouble should be a new window in the Eastern wall of your house You may forget the one with whom you have laughed but never the one with wnom you have wept There be something strangely sacred in salt It is in our tears and in the sea Our God In His gracious thirst will drink us all the dewdrop and the tear You are but a fragment of your giant self a mouth that bread and a blind hand that holds the cup for a thirsty mouth If you would rise but a cubit above race and country and self you would indeed become godlike If I were you I would not find fault with the sea at low tide It is a good ship and our Captain is able it Is only your stomach that is in disorder What we long for and cannot attain is dearer than what we have already attained Should you sit upon a cloud you would not see the boundary line between one country another nor the boundary stone between a farm and a farm It Is a pity you cannot sit upon a cloud Seven centuries ago seven white doves rose from a deep valley flying to the snowwhite summit of the mountain One of the seven who watched the flight said I see a black spot on the wing of the seventh dove Today the people in that valley tell of seven black doves that flew to the summit of the snowy mountain In the autumn I gathered all my sorrows and buried them in my garden And when April returned and spring came to wed the earth there grew in my garden beautiful flowers unlike all other flowers And my neighbours came to behold them and they all said to me When autumn comes again at seeding time will you not give us of the seeds of these flowers that we may have them in our gardens It is indeed misery if I stretch an empty hand to men to receive nothing kut it is hopeless if I stretch a full hand and find none to receive I long for eternity because there I shall meet my unwritten poems and my unpalnted pictures Art is a step from nature toward the infinite A work of art is a mist carved into an image Even the hands that make crowns of thorns are better than idle hands Our most sacred tears never seek our eyes Every man is the descendant of every king and every slave ever lived If the greatgrandfather of Jesus had known what was hidden within him would he not have stood in awe of himself Was the love of Judas mother for her son less than the love of Mary for Jesus You may have heard of the Blessed Mountain It is the highest mountain in our world Should you reach the summit you would have only one desire and that to descend and be with those who dwell in the deepest valley That is why it is called the Blessed Mountain Every thought I have imprisoned in expression I must free by my deeds Almustafa the chosen and the beloved who was a noon unto his own day returned to the isle of his birth in the month of Tichreen which is the month of remembrance And as his ship approached the harbour he stood upon its prow and his mariners were about him And there was a homecoming in his heart And he spoke and the sea was in his voice and he said Behold the isle of our birth Even here the earth heaved us a song and a riddle a song unto the sky a riddle unto the earth and what is there between earth and sky that shall carry the song and solve the riddle save our own passion The sea yields us once more to these shores We are but another wave of her waves She sends us forth to sound her speech but how shall we do so unless we break the symmetry of our heart on rock and sand For this is the law of mariners and the sea If you would freedom you must needs turn to mist The formless is for ever seeking form even as the countless nebulae would become suns and moons and we who have sought much and return now to this isle rigid moulds we must become mist once more and learn of the beginning And what is there that shall live and rise unto the heights except it be broken unto passion and freedom For ever shall we be in quest of the shores that we may sing and be heard But what of the wave that breaks where no ear shall hear It is the unheard in us that nurses our deeper sorrow Yet it is also the unheard which carves our soul to form and fashion our destiny Then one of his mariners came forth and said Master you have captained our longing for this harbour and behold we have come Yet you speak of sorrow and of hearts that shall be broken And he answered him and said Did I not speak of freedom and of the mist which is our greater freedom Yet it is in pain I make pilgrimage to the isle where i was born even like unto a ghost of one slain come to kneel before those who have slain him And another mariner spoke and said Behold the multitudes on the seawall In their silence they have fortold even the day and the hour of your coming and they have gathered from their fields and vineyards in their loving need to await you And Almustafa looked afar upon the multitudes and his heart was mindful of their yearning and he was silent Then a cry came from the people and it was a cry of remembrance and of entreaty And he looked upon his mariners and said And what have I brought them A hunter was I in a distant land With aim and might i have spent the golden arrows they gave me but I have brought down no game I followed not the arrows Mayhap they are spreading now in the sun with the pinions of wounded eagles that would not fall to the earth And mayhap the arrowheads have fallen into the hands of those who had need of them for bread and wine I know not where they have spent their flight but this I know they have made their curve in the sky Even so loves hand is still upon me and you my mariners still sail my vision and I shal not be dumb I shall cry out when the hand of the seasons is upon my throat and I shall sing my words when my lips are burned with flames And they were troubled in their hearts because he spoke of these things And one said Master teach us all and mayhap because your blood flows in our veins and our breath is of your fragrance we shall understand The he answered them and the wind was in his voice ans he said Brought you me to the isle of my birth to be a teacher Not yet have I been caged by wisdom Too young am I and too verdant to speak of aught but self which is for ever the deep calling upon the deep Let him who would have wisdom seek it in the buttercup or in a pinch of red clay I am still the singer Still I shall sing the earth and I shall sing your lost dreaming that walks the day between sleep and sleep But I shall gaze upon the sea And now the ship entered the harbour and reached the seawall and he came thus to the isle of his birth and stood once more amongst his own people And a great cry arose from their hearts so that the loneliness of his homecoming was shaken within him And they were silent awaiting his word but he amswered them not for the sadness of memory was upon him and he said in his heart Have I said that I shall sing Nay I can but open my lips that the voice of life may come forth and go out to the wind for joy and support Then Karima she who had played with him a child in the Garden of his mother spoke and said Twelve years have you hidden your face from us and for twelve years have we hungered and thirsted for your voice And he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness for it was she who had closed the eyes of his mother when the white wings of death had gathered her And he answered and said Twelve years Said you twelve years Karima I measured not my longing with the starry rod nor did I sound the depth thereof For love when love is homesick exhausts times measurements and times soundings There are moments that hold aeons of separation Yet parting is naught but an exhaustion of the mind Perhaps we have not parted And Almustafa looked upon the people and he saw them all the youth and the aged the stalwart and the puny those who were ruddy with the touch of wind and sun and those who were of pallid countenance and upon their face a light of longing and of questioning And one spoke and said Master life has dealt bitterly with our hopes and our desires Our hearts are troubled and we do not understand I pray you comfort us and open to us the meanings of our sorrows And his heart was moved with compassion and he said Life is older than all things living even as beauty was winged ere the beautiful was born on earth and even as truth was truth ere it was uttered Life sings in our silences and dreams in our slumber Even when we are beaten and low Life is enthroned and high And when we weep Life smiles upon the day and is free even when we drag our chains Oftentimes we call Life bitter names but only when we ourselves are bitter and dark And we deem her empty and unprofitable but only when the soul goes wandering in desolate places and the heart is drunken with overmindfulness of self Life is deep and high and distant and though only your vast vision can reach even her feet yet she is near and though only the breath of your breath reaches her heart the shadow of your shadow crosses her face and the echo of your faintest cry becomes a spring and an autumn in her breast And Life is veiled and hidden even as your greater self is hidden and veiled Yet when Life speaks all the winds become words and when she speaks again the smiles upon your lips and the tears in your eyes turn also into words When she sings the deaf hear and are held and when shecomes walking the sightless behold her and are amazed and follow her in wonder and astonishment And he ceased from speaking and a vast silence enfolded the people and in the silence there was an unheard song and they were comforted of their loneliness and their aching And he left them straightway and followed the path which led to his Garden which was the Garden of his mother and his father wherein they lay asleep they and their forefathers And there were those who would have followed after him seeing that it was a homecoming and he was alone for there was not one left of all his kin to spread the feast of welcome after the manner of his people But the captain of his ship counselled them saying Suffer him to go upon his way For his bread is the bread of aloneness and in his cup is the wine of remembrance which he would drink alone And his mariners held their steps for they knew it was even as the captain of the ship had told them And all those who gathered upon the seawall restrained the feet of their desire Only Karima went after him a little way yearning over his aloneness and his memories And she spoke not but turned and went unto her own house and in the garden under the almondtree she wept yet she knew not wherefore And Almustafa came and found the Garden of his mother and his father and he entered in and closed the gate that no man might come after him And for forty days and forty nights he dwelt alone in that house and that Garden and none came not even unto the gate for it was closed and all the people knew that he would be alone And when the forty days and nights were ended Almustafa opened the gate that they might come in And there came nine men to be with him in th Garden three mariners from his own ship three who had been his comrades in play when they were but children together And these were his disciples And on a morning his disciples sat around him and there were distances and remembrances in his eyes And that disciple who was called Hafiz said unto him Master tel us of the city of Orphalese and of that land wherein you tarried those twelve years And Almustafa was silent and he looked away towards the hills and toward the vast ether and there was a battle in his silence Then he said My friends and my roadfellows pity the nation that is full of beliefs and empty of religion Pity the nation that wears a cloth it does not weave eats a bread it does not harvest and drinks a wine that flows not from its own winepress Pity the nation that acclaims the bully as hero and that deems the glittering conqueror bountiful Pity the nation that despises a passion in its dream yet submits in its awakening Pity the nation that raisesnot its voice save when it walks in a funeral boasts not except when its neck is laid between the sword and the block Pity the nation whose statesman is a fox whose philosopher is a juggle and whose art is the art of patching and mimicking Pity the nation that welcomes its new ruler with trumpetings and farewells him with hootings only to welcome another with trumpetings again Pity the nation whose sages are dumb with years and whose strong men are yet in the cradle Pity the nation divided into fragments each fragment deeming itself a nation And one said Speak to us of that which is moving in your own heart even now And he looked upon that one and there was in his voice a sound like a star singing and he said In your waking dream when you are hushed and listening to your deeper self your thoughts like snow flakes fall and flutter and garment all the sounds of your spaces with white silence And what are waking dreams but clouds that bud and blossom on the skytree of your heart And what are your thoughts but the petals which the winds of your heart scatter upon the hills and its fields And even as you wait for peace until the formless within you takes form so shall the cloud gather and drift until the Blessed Fingers shape its grey desire to little crystal suns and moons and stars Then Sarkis he who was the halfdoubter spoke and said But spring shall come and all the snows of our dreams and our thoughts shall melt and be no more And he answered saying When Spring comes to seek His beloved amongst the slumbering groves and vineyards the snows shall indeed melt and shall run in streams to seek the river in the valley to be the cupbearer to the myrtletrees and laurel So shall the snow of your heart melt when your Spring is come and thus shall your secret run in streams to seek the river of life in the valley And the river shall enfold your secret and carry it to the great sea All things shall melt and turn into songs when Spring comes Even the stars the vast snowflakes that fall slowly upon the larger fields shall melt into singing streams When the sun of His face shall rise above the wider horizon then what frozen symmetry would not turn into liquid melody And who among you would not be the cupbearer to the myrtle and the laurel It was but yesterday that you were moving with the moving sea and you were shoreless and without a self Then the wind the breath of Life wove you a veil of light on her face then her hand gathered you and gave you form and with a head held high you sought the heights But the sea followed after you and her song is still with you And though you have forgotten your parentage she will for ever assert her motherhood and for ever will she call you unto her In your wanderings among the mountains and the desert you will always remember the depth of her cool heart And though oftentimes you will not know for what you long it is indeed for her vast and rhythmic peace And how else can it be In grove and in bower when the rain dances in leaves upon the hill when snow falls a blessing and a covenant in the valley when you lead your flocks to the river in your fields where brooks like silver streams join together the green garment in your gardens when the early dews mirror the heavens in your meadows when the mist of evening half veils your way in all these the sea is with you a witness to your heritage and a claim upon your love It is the snowflake in you running down to the sea And on a morning as they walked in the Garden there appeared before the gate a woman and it was Karima she whom Almustafa had loved even as a sister in his boyhood And she stood without asking nothing nor knocking with her hand upon the gate but only gazing with longing and sadness into the Garden And Almustafa saw the desire upon her eyelids and with swift steps he came to the wall and the gate and opened unto her and she came in and was made welcome And she spoke and said Wherefore have you withdrawn yourself from us altogether that we may not live in the light of your countenance For behold these many years have we loved you and waited with longing for your safe return And now the people cry for you and would have speech with you and I am their messenger come to beseech you that you will show yourself to the people and speak to them out of your wisdom and comfort the broken of heart and instruct our foolishness And looking upon her he said Call me not wise unless you call all men wise A young fruit am I still clinging to the branch and it was only yesterday that I was but a blossom And call none among you foolish for in truth we are neither wise nor foolish We are green leaves upon the tree of life and life itself is beyond wisdom and surely beyond foolishness And have I indeed withdrawn myself from you Know you not that there is no distance save that which the soul does not span in fancy And when the soul shall span that distance it becomes a rhythm in the soul The space that lies between you and your near neighbour unbefriended is indeed greater than that which lies between you and your beloved who dwells beyond seven lands and seven seas For in remembrance there are no distances and only in oblivion is there a gulf that neither your voice nor your eye can abridge Between the shores of the oceans and the summit of the highest mountain there is a secret road which you must needs travel ere you become one with the sons of earth And between your knowledge and your understanding there is a secret path which you must needs discover ere you become one with man and therefore one with yourself Between your right hand that gives and your left hand that receives there is a great space Only by deeming them both giving and receiving can you bring them into spacelessness for it is only in knowing that you have naught to give and naught to receive that you can overcome space Verily the vastest distance is that which lies between your sleepvision and your wakefulness and between that which is but a deed and that which is a desire And there is still another road which you must needs travel ere you become one with Life But of that road I shall not speak now seeing that you are weary already of travelling Then he went forth with the woman he and the nine even unto the marketplace and he spoke to the people his friends and his neighbours and there was joy in their hearts and upon their eyelids And he said You grow in sleep and live your fuller life in you dreaming For all your days are spent in thanksgiving for that which you have received in the stillness of the night Oftentimes you think and speak of night as the season of rest yet in truth night is the season of seeking and finding The day gives unto you the power of knowledge and teaches your fingers to become versed in the art of receiving but it is night that leads you to the treasurehouse of Life The sun teaches to all things that grow their longing for the light But it is night that raises them to the stars It is indeed the stillness of the night that weaves a weddingveil over the trees in the forest and the flowers in the garden and then spreads the lavish feast and makes ready the nuptial chamber and in that holy silence tomorrow is conceived in the womb of Time Thus it is with you and thus in seeking you find meat and fulfillment And though at dawn your awakening erases the memory the board of dreams is for ever spread and the nuptial chamber waiting And he was silent for a space and they also awaiting his word Then he spoke again saying You are spirits though you move in bodies and like oil that burns in the dark you are flames though held in lamps If you were naught save bodies then my standing before you and speaking unto you would be but emptiness even as the dead calling unto the dead But this is not so All that is deathless in you is free unto the day and the night and cannot be housed nor fettered for this is the will of the Most High You are His breath even as the wind that shall be neither caught nor caged And I also am the breath of His breath And he went from their midst walking swiftly and entered again into the Garden And Sarkis he who was the halfdoubter spoke and said And what of ugliness Master You speak never of ugliness And Almustafa answered him and there was a whip in his words and he said My friend what man shall call you inhospitable if he shall pass by your house yet would not knock at your door And who shall deem you deaf and unmindful if he shall speak to you in a strange tongue of which you understand nothing Is it not that which you have never striven to reach into whose heart you have never desired to enter that you deem ugliness If ugliness is aught indeed it is but the scales upon our eyes and the wax filling our ears Call nothing ugly my friend save the fear of a soul in the presence of its own memories And upon a day as they sat in the long shadows of the white poplars one spoke saying Master I am afraid of time It passes over us and robs us of our youth and what does it give in return And he answered and said Take up now a handful of good earth Do you find in it a seed and perhaps a worm If your hand were spacious and enduring enough the seed might become a forest and the worm a flock of angels And forget not that the years which turn seeds to forests and worms to angels belong to this Now all of the years this very Now And what are the seasons of the years save your own thoughts changing Spring is an awakening in your breast and summer but a recognition of your own fruitfulness Is not autumn the ancient in you singing a lullaby to that which is still a child in your being And what I ask you is winter save sleep big with the dreams of all the other seasons And the Mannus the inquisitive disciple looked about him and he saw plants in flower cleaving unto the sycamoretree And he said Behold the parasites Master What say you of them They are thieves with weary eyelids who steal the light from the streadfast children of the sun and make fair of the sap that runneth into their branches and their leaves And he answered him saying My friend we are all parasites We who labour to turn the sod into pulsing life are not above those who receive life directly from the sod without knowing the sod Shall a mother say to her child I give you back to the forest which is your greater mother for you weary me heart and hand Or shall the singer rebuke his own song saying Return now to the cave of echoes from whence you came for your voice consumes my breath And shall the shepherd say to his yearling I have no pasture whereunto I may lead you therefore be cut off and become a sacrifice for this cause Nay my friend all these things are answered even before they are asked and like your dreams are fulfilled ere you sleep We live upon one another according to the law ancient and timeless Let us live thus in lovingkindness We seek one another in our aloneness and we walk the road when we have no hearth to sit beside My friends and my brothers the wider road is your fellowman These plants that live upon the tree draw milk of the earth in the sweet stillness of night and the earth in her tranquil dreaming sucks at the breast of the sun And the sun even as you and I and all there is sits in equal honour at the banquet of the Prince whose door is always open and whose board is always spread Mannus my friend all there is lives always upon all there is and all there is lives in the faith shoreless upon the bounty of the Most High And on a morning when the sky was yet pale with dawn they walked all together in the Garden and looked unto the East and were silent in the presence of the rising sun And after a while Almustafa pointed with his hand and said The image of the morning sun in a dewdrop is not less than the sun The reflection of life in your soul is not less than life The dewdrop mirrors the light because it is one with light and you reflect life because you and life are one When darkness is upon you say This darkness is dawn not yet born and though nights travail be full upon me yet shall dawn be born unto me even as unto the hills The dewdrop rounding its sphere in the dusk of the lily is not unlike yourself gathering your soul in the heart of God Shall a dewdrop say But once in a thousand years I am a dewdrop speak you and answer it saying Know you not that the light of all the years is shining in your circle And on an evening a great storm visited the place and Almustafa and his disciples the nine went within and sat about the fire and were silent Then one of the disciples said I am alone Master and the hoofs of the hours beat heavily upon my breast And Almustafa rose up and stood in their midst and he said in a voice like unto the sound of a great wind Alone And what of it You came alone and alone shall you pass into the mist Therefore drink your cup alone and in silence The autumn days have given other lips other cups and filled them with wine bitter and sweet even as they have filled your cup Drink your cup alone though it taste of your own blood and tears and praise life for the gift of thirst For without thirst your heart is but the shore of a barren sea songless and without a tide Drink your cup alone and drink it with cheers Raise it high above your head and drink deep to those who drink alone Once I sought the company of men and sat with them at their banquettables and drank deep with them but their wine did not rise to my head nor did it flow into my bosom It only descended to my feet My wisdom was left dry and my heart was locked and sealed Only my feet were with them in their fog And I sought the company of men no more nor drank wine with them at their board Therefore I say unto you though the hoofs of the hours beat heavily upon your bosom what of it It is well for you to drink your cup of sorrow alone and your cup of joy shall you drink alone also And on a day as Phardrous the Greek walked in the Garden he struck his foot upon a stone and he was angered And he turned and picked up the stone saying in a low voice O dead thing in my path and he flung away the stone And Almustafa the chosen and the beloved said Why say you O dead thing Have you been thus long in this Garden and know not that there is nothing dead here All things live and glow in the knowledge of the day and the majesty of the night You and the stone are one There is a difference only in heartbeats Your heart beats a little faster does it my friend Ay but it is not so tranquil Its rhythm may be another rhythm but I say unto you that if you sound the depths of your soul and scale the heights of space you shall hear one melody and in that melody the stone and the star sing the one with the other in perfect unison If my words reach not your understanding then let be until another dawn If you have cursed this stone because in your blindness you have stumbled upon it then would you curse a star if so be your head should encounter it in the sky But the day will come when you will gather stones and stars as a child plucks the valleylilies and then shall you know that all these things are living and fragrant And on the first day of the week when the sounds of the temple bells sought their ears one spoke and said Master we hear much talk of God hereabout What say you of God and who is He in very truth And he stood before them like a young tree fearless of wind or tempest and he answered saying Think now my comrades and beloved of a heart that contains all your hearts a love that encompasses all your loves a spirit that envelops all your spirits a voice enfolding all your voices and a silence deeper than all your silences and timeless Seek now to perceive in your selffulness a beauty more enchanting than all things beautiful a song more vast than the songs of the sea and the forest a majesty seated upon the throne for which Orion is but a footstool holding a sceptre in which the Pleiades are naught save the glimmer of dewdrops You have sought always only food and shelter a garment and a staff seek now One who is neither an aim for your arrows nor a stony cave to shield you from the elements And if my words are a rock and a riddle then seek none the less that your hearts may be broken and that your questionings may bring you unto the love and the wisdom of the Most High whom men call God And they were silent every one and they were perplexed in their heart and Almustafa was moved with compassion for them and he gazed with tenderness upon them and said Let us speak rather of the gods your neighbours and of your brothers the elements that move about your houses and your fields You would rise up in fancy unto the cloud and you deem it height and you would pass over the vast sea and claim it to be distance But I say unto you that when you sow a seed in the earth you reach a greater height and when you hail the beauty of the morning to your neighbour you cross a greater sea Too often do you sing God the Infinite and yet in truth you hear not the song Would that you might listen to the songbirds and to the leaves that forsake the branch when the wind passes by and forget not my friends that these sing only when they are separated from the branch Again I bid you to speak not so freely of God who is your All but speak rather and understand one another neighbour unto neighbour a god unto a god For what shall feed the fledgling in the nest if the mother bird flies skyward And what anemone in the fields shall be fulfilled unless it be husbanded by a bee from another anemone It is only when you are lost in your smaller selves that you seek the sky which you call God Would that you might find paths into your vast selves would that you might be less idle and pave the roads My mariners and my friends it were wiser to speak less of God whom we cannot understand and more of each other whom we may understand Yet I would have you know that we are the breath and the fragrance of God We are God in leaf in flower and oftentimes in fruit And on a morning when the sun was high one of the disciples one of those three who had played with him in childhood approached him saying Master my garment is worn and I have no other Give me leave to go unto the marketplace and bargain that perchance I may procure me new raiment And Almustafa looked upon the young man and he said Give me your garment And he did so and stood naked in the noonday And Almustafa said in a voice that was like a young steed running upon a road Only the naked live in the sun Only the artless ride the wind And he alone who loses his way a thousand times shall have a homecoming The angels are tired of the clever And it was but yesterday that an angel said to me We created hell for those who glitter What else but fire can erase a shining surface and melt a thing to its core And I said But in creating hell you created devils to govern hell But the angel answered Nay hell is governed by those who do not yield to fire Wise angel He knows the ways of men and the ways of halfmen He is one of the seraphim who come to minister unto the prophets when they are tempted by the clever And no doubt he smiled when the prophets smile and weeps also when they weep My friends and my mariners only the naked live in the sun Only the rudderless can sail the greater sea Only he who is dark with the night shall wake with the dawn and only he who sleeps with the roots under the snow shall reach the spring For you are even like roots and like roots are you simple yet you have wisdom from the earth And you are silent yet you have within your unborn branches the choir of the four winds You are frail and you are formless yet you are the beginning of giant oaks and of the halfpencilled patterned of the willows against the sky Once more I say you are but roots betwixt the dark sod and the moving heavens And oftentimes have I seen you rising to dance with the light but I have also seen you shy All roots are shy They have hidden their hearts so long that they know not what to do with their hearts But May shall come and May is a restless virgin and she shall mother the hills and plains And one who had served in the Temple besought him saying Teach us Master that our words may be even as your words a chant and an incense unto the people And Almustafa answered and said You shall rise beyond your words but your path shall remain a rhythm and a fragrance a rhythm for lovers and for all who are beloved and a fragrance for those who would live life in a garden But you shall rise beyond your words to a summit whereon the stardust falls and you shall open your hands until they are filled then you shall lie down and sleep like a white fledgling in a white nest and you shall dream of your tomorrow as white violets dream of spring Ay and you shall go down deeper than your words You shall seek the lost fountainheads of the streams and you shall be a hidden cave echoing the faint voices of the depths which now you do not even hear You shall go down deeper than your words ay deeper than all sounds to the very heart of the earth and there you shall be alone with Him who walks also upon the Milky Way And after a space one of the disciples asked him saying Master speak to us of being What is it to be And Almustafa looked long upon him and loved him And he stood up and walked a distance away from them then returning he said In this Garden my father and my mother lie buried by the hands of the living and in this Garden lie buried the seeds of yesteryear bought hither upon the wings of the wind A thousand times shall my mother and my father be buried here and a thousand times shall the wind bury the seed and a thousand years hence shall you and I and these flowers come together in this Garden even as now and we shall be loving life and we shall be dreaming of space and we shall be rising towards the sun But now today to be is to be wise though not a stranger to the foolish it is to be strong but not to the undoing of the weak to play with young children not as fathers but rather as playmates who would learn their games To be simple and guileless with old men and women and to sit with them in the shade of the ancient oaktrees though you are still walking with Spring To seek a poet though he may live beyond the seven rivers and to be at peace in his presence nothing wanting nothing doubting and with no question upon your lips To know that the saint and the sinner are twin brothers whose father is our Gracious King and that one was born but the moment before the other wherefore we regard his as the Crowned Prince To follow Beauty even when she shall lead you to the verge of the precipice and though she is winged and you are wingless and though she shall pass beyond the verge follow her for where Beauty is not there is nothing To be a garden without walls a vineyard without a guardian a treasurehouse for ever open to passersby To be robbed cheated deceived ay misled and trapped and then mocked yet with it all to look down from the height of your larger self and smile knowing that there is spring that will come to your garden to dance in your leaves and an autumn to ripen your grapes knowing that if but one of your windows is open to the East you shall never be empty knowing that all those deemed wrongdoers and robbers cheaters and deceivers are your brothers in need and that you are perchance all of these in the eyes of the blessed inhabitants of that City Invisible above this city And now to you also whose hands fashion and find all things that are needful for the comfort of our days and our nights To be is to be a weaver with seeing fingers a builder mindful of light and space to be a ploughman and feel that you are hiding a treasure with every seed you sow to be a fisherman and a hunter with a pity for the fish and for the beast yet a still greater pity for the hunger and need of man And above all I say this I would have you each and every one partners to the purpose of every man for only so shall you hope to obtain your own good purpose My comrades and my beloved be bold and not meek be spacious and not confined and until my final hour and yours be indeed your greater self And he ceased speaking and there fell a deep gloom upon the nine and their heart was turned away from him for they understood not his words And behold the three men who were mariners longed for the sea and they who had served in the Temple yearned for the consolation of her santuary and they who had been his playfellows desired the marketplace They all were deaf to his words so that the sound of them returned unto him like weary and homeless birds seeking refuge And Almustafa walked a distance from them in the Garden saying nothing nor looking upon them And they began to reason among themselves and to seek excuse for their longing to be gone And behold they turned and went every man to his own place so that Almustafa the chosen and the beloved was left alone And when the night was fully come he took his steps to the graveside of his mother and sat beneath the cedartree which grew above the place And there came the shadow of a great light upon the sky and the Garden shone like a fair jewel upon the breast of earth And Almustafa cried out in the aloneness of his spirit and he said Heavyladen is my soul with her own ripe fruit Who is there would come and take and be satisfied Is there not one who has fasted and who is kindly and generous in heart to come and break his fast upon my first yieldings to the sun and thus ease me of the weight of mine own abundance My soul is running over with the wine of the ages Is there no thirsty one to come and drink Behold there was a man standing at the crossroads with hands stretched forth unto the passersby and his hands were filled with jewels And he called upon the passersby saying Pity me and take from me In Gods name take out of my hands and console me But the passersby only looked upon him and none took out of his hand Would rather that he were a beggar stretching forth his hand to receive ay a shivering hand and brought back empty to his bosom than to stretch it forth full of rich gifts and find none to receive And behold there was also the gracious prince who raised up his silken tents between the mountain and the desert and bade his servants to burn fire a sign to the stranger and the wanderer and who sent forth his slaves to watch the road that they might fetch a guest But the roads and the paths of the desert were unyielding and they found no one Would rather that prince were a man of nowhere and nowhen seeking food and shelter Would that he were the wanderer with naught but his staff and an earthen vessel For then at nightfall would he meet with his kind and with the poets of nowhere and nowhen and share their beggary and their remembrances and their dreaming And behold the daughter of the great king rose from sleep and put upon her her silken raiment and her pearls and rubies and she scattered musk upon her hair and dipped her fingers in amber Then she descended from her tower to her garden where the dew of night found her golden sandals In the stillness of the night the daughter of a ploughman tending his sheep in a field and returning to her fathers house at eventide with the dust of the curving roads upon her feet and the fragrance of the vineyards in the folds of her garment And when the night is come andthe angel of the night is upon the world she would steal her steps to the rivervalley where her lover awaits Would that she were a nun in a cloister burning her heart for incense that her heart may rise to the wind and exhausting her spirit a candle for a light arising toward the greater light together with all those who worship and those who love and are beloved Would rather that she were a woman ancient of years sitting in the sun and remembering who had shared her youth And the night waxed deep and Almustafa was dark with the night and his spirit was as a cloud unspent And he cried again Heavyladen is my soul with her own ripe fruit Heavyladen is my soul with her fruit Who now will come and eat and be fulfilled My soul is overflowing with her wine Who now will pour and drink and be cooled of the desert heat Would thatI were a tree flowerless and fruitless For the pain of abundance is more bitter than barrenness And the sorrow of the rich from whom no one will take Is greater than the grief of the beggar to whom none would give Would that I were a well dry and parched and men throwing stones into me For this were better and easier to be borne than to be a source of living water When men pass by and will not drink Would that I were a reed trodden under foot For that were better than to be a lyre of silvery strings In a house whose lord has no fingers And whose children are deaf Now for seven days and seven nights no man came nigh the Garden and he was alone with is memories and his pain for even those who had heard his words with love and patience had turned away to the pursuits of other days Only Karima came with silence upon her face like a veil and with cup and plate within her hand drink and meat for his aloneness and his hunger And after setting these before him she walked her way And Almustafa came again to the company of the white poplars within the gate and he sat looking upon the road And after a while he beheld as it were a cloud of dust blown above the road and coming toward him And from out the cloud came the nine and before them Karima guiding them And Almustafa advanced and met them upon the road and they passed through the gate and all was well as though they had gone their path but an hour ago They came in and supped with him at his frugal board after that Karima had laid upon it the bread and the fish and poured the last of the wine into the cups And as she poured she besought the Master saying Give me leave that I go into the city and fetch wine to replenish your cups for this is spent And he looked upon her and in his eyes were a journey and a far country and he said Nay for it is sufficent unto the hour And they ate and drank and were satisfied And when it was finished Almustafa spoke in a vast voice deep as the seaa and full as a great tide under the moon and he said My comradess and my roadfellows we must needs part this day Long have we climbed the steepest mountains and we have wrestled with the storms We have known hunger but we have also sat at weddingfeasts Oftentimes have we been naked but we have also worn kingly raiment We have indeed travelled far but now we part Together you shall go your way and alone must I go mine And though the seas and the vast lands shall separate us still we shall be companions upon our journey to the Holy Mountain But before we go our severed roads I would give unto you the harvest and the gleaning of my heart Go you upon your way with singing but let each song be brief for only the songs that die young upon your lips shall live in human hearts Tell a lovely truth in little words but never an ugly truth in any words Tell the maiden whose hair shines in the sun that she is the daughter of the morning But if you shall behold the sightless say not to him that he is one with night Listen to the fluteplayer as it were listening to April but if you shall hear the critic and the faultfinder speak be deaf as your own bones and as distant as your fancy My comrades and my beloved upon your way you shall meet men with hoofs give them your wings And men with horns give them wreaths of laurel And men with claws give them petals for fingers And men with forked tongues give them honey words Ay you shall meet all these and more you shall meet the lame selling crutches and the blind mirrors And you shall meet the rich men begging at the gate of the Temple To the lame give your swiftness to the blind of your vision and see that you give of yourself to the rich beggars they are the most needy of all for surely no man would stretch a hand for alms unless he be poor indeed though of great possessions My comrades and my friends I charge you by our love that you be countless paths which cross one another in the desert where the lions and the rabbits walk and also the wolves and the sheep And remember this of me I teach you not giving but receiving not denial but fulfilment and not yielding but understanding with the smile upon the lips I teach you not silence but rather a song not overloud I teach you your larger self which contains all men And he rose from the board and went out straightway into the Garden and walked under the shadow of the cypresstrees as the day waned And they followed him at a little distance for their heart was heavy and their tongue clave to the roof of their mouth Only Karima after she had put by the fragments came unto him and said Master I would that you suffer me to prepare food against the morrow and your journey And he looked upon her with eyes that saw other worlds that this and he said My sister and my beloved it is done even from the beginning of time The food and the drink is ready for the morrow even as for our yesterday and our today I go but if I go with a truth not yet voiced that very truth will again seek me and gather me though my elements be scattered throughout the silences of eternity and again shall I come before you that I may speak with a voice born anew out of the heart of those boundless silences And if there be aught of beauty that I have declared not unto you then once again shall I be called ay even by mine own name Almustafa and I shall give you a sign that you may know I have come back to speak all that is lacking for God will not suffer Himself to be hidden from man nor His word to lie covered in the abyss of the heart of man I shall live beyond death and I shall sing in your ears Even after the vast seawave carries me back To the vast seadepth I shall sit at your board though without a body And I shall go with you to your fields a spirit invisible I shall come to you at your fireside a guest unseen Death changes nothing but the masks that cover our faces The woodsman shall be still a woodsman The ploughman a ploughman And he who sang his song to the wind shall sing it also to the moving spheres And the disciples were as still as stones and grieved in their heart for that he had said I go But no man put out his hand to stay the Master nor did any follow after his footsteps And Almustafa went out from the Garden of his mother and his feet were swift and they were soundless and in a moment like a blown leaf in a strong wind he was far gone from them and they saw as it were a pale light moving up to the heights And the nine walked their ways down the road But the woman still stood in the gathering night and she beheld how the light and the twilight were become one and she comforted her desolation and her aloneness with his words I go but if I go with a truth not yet voiced that very truth will seek me and gather me and again shall I come And now it was eventide And he had reached the hills His steps had led him to the mist and he stood among the rocks and the white cypresstrees hidden from all things and he spoke and said O Mist my sister white breath not yet held in a mould I return to you a breath white and voiceless A word not yet uttered O Mist my winged sister mist we are together now And together we shall be till lifes second day Whose dawn shall lay you dewdrops in a garden And me a babe upon the breast of a woman And we shall remember O Mist my sister I come back a heart listening in its depths Even as your heart A desire throbbing and aimless even as your desire A thought not yet gathered even as your thought O Mist my sister firstborn of my mother My hands still hold the green seeds you bade me scatter And my lips are sealed upon the song you bade me sing And I bring you no fruit and I bring you no echoes For my hands were blind and my lips unyielding O Mist my sister much did I love the world and the world loved me For all my smiles were upon her lips and all her tears were in my eyes Yet there was between us a gulf of silence which she would not abridge And I could not overstep O Mist my sister my deathless sister Mist I sang the ancient songs unto my little children And they listened and there was wondering upon their face But tomorrow perchance they will forget the song And I know not to whom the sind will carry the song And though it was not mine own yet it came to my heart And dwelt for a moment upon my lips O Mist my sister though all this came to pass I am at peace It was enough to sing to those already born And though the singing is indeed not mine Yet it is of my hearts deepest desire O Mist my sister my sister Mist I am one with you now No longer am I a self The walls have fallen And the chains have broken I rise to you a mist And together we shall float upon the sea until lifes second day When dawn shall lay you dewdrops in a garden And me a babe upon the breast of a woman
